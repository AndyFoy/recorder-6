<!-- CORRECTIONS OF VARIOUS DATA ERRORS IDENTIFIED BY reports sy6 and sy7
     XML Btach Update by Mike Weideli of Littlefield Consultancy 
     Version 1.0 - 17/8/2010
     
     Works on all records even if they are not in the custodianship of the system. 

     Data records with no accuarcy - sets to 'Estimate'
     Spaces in Grid Refrences (OSGB and OSNI)
     Verified Flag  
     Inserts word 'Grid' into spatial_ref_system where the spatial_ref is null. This brings this field into line with the approach used in Recorder 6.
