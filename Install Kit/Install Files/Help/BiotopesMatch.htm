  <P>
   Please match the Biotopes from your import to those in the Recorder 
   6 Biotopes Dictionary.</P>
  <P>
   Choose an appropriate list and hit the search button to make 
   automatic matches to either the Biotope's code or its name or a 
   combination of the two. Repeat using a different list if necessary. 
   Any remaining Biotopes must be matched manually. Again, automatic 
   matches will be made based on previous decisions but will be coloured 
   green so that you can check them</P>
  <P>
  For more details please see the <A HREF="159">Matching help</A> or 
   the <A HREF="79">Import wizard overview</A>
