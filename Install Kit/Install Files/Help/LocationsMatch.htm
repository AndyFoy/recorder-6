	<P>
	Please match the Locations from your import to those in <I>Recorder 6</I> or add new locations where appropriate by 
	selecting the name and clicking on the &lt;Make New Entry&gt; button. The grid reference will be stored as the site 
	centroid of the location created using this method.
	</P>
	<P>
	Again, automatic matches will be made based on previous decisions, but you can click in the ‘Recorder Matches’ cells 
	and use the search button to match the location in the import file with a different location in <I>Recorder 6</I>. You can 
	also delete any matches made by selecting the text in the relevant cell in the ‘Recorder Matches’ column and pressing 
	the &lt;Delete&gt; key.
	</P>
	<P>
	If you do not wish to create new locations or store records against existing locations in <I>Recorder 6</I>, you must 
	select to store the location information provided in the location name field – this is a free text field stored within 
	the appropriate survey events and samples created. The spatial reference provided in the import file will also be stored 
	in the Spatial Ref. field of the survey events and samples created. Ensure that the rows you do not wish to match to a 
	location have no information in the ‘Recorder Matches’ column, then select the ‘Place any remaining unmatched locations 
	into the location name’ option. This will store the location information provided in the import file in the location name 
	field for All the remaining unmatched locations.
	</P>
