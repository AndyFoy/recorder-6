   Please match the references in your import to items already within <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">Unlike most other 
   matching pages there is no &lt;Make new entry&gt; option as creating 
   a reference is a more complicated process. If a new reference is 
   needed use the magnifying glass option to move to the References Screen
    and add the necessary entry there. </SPAN>
