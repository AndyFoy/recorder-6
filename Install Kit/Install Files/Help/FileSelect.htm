  <P>
   Your import is not in a standard NBN format so you will be asked for 
   some additional information so that the data can be added correctly 
   to <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   Click on the &lt;more&gt; button to see other formatting options</P>
  <P>
   If you import data in the same format on a regular basis you may 
   choose to make use of the template functionality. Save your choices 
   at any stage of the import as a template using the option at the 
   bottom of the page. This template can be used in later imports to 
   save you time. For more details please see the <A HREF="156">file 
   selection help</A> or the <A HREF="79">Import wizard overview</A>
