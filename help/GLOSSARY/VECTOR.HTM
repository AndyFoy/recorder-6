   Vector</H1>
  <P>
   A vector is a representation of a shape on a computer screen which is 
   created by joining up the constituent co-ordinates of the shape, much 
   like join-the-dots. It is a widely used method for representing 
   shapes in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) along with Rasters.
