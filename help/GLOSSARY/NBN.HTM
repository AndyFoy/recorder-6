   NBN (National Biodiversity Network).</H1>
  <P>
   In the UK there is an enormous amount of biodiversity information 
   that has been gathered over the years by all sorts of organisations 
   and individuals. Most of these people are volunteers who organise 
   themselves through many national and local societies and recording 
   schemes. The UK government (through its conservation and 
   environmental agencies), local government and non-government 
   wildlife-related organisations all collect and use biodiversity data. 
   One of the principal means of collation and interpretation of this 
   data is the network of local records centres and at the national 
   level, the Biological Records Centre that collates and interprets 
   data from national recording schemes.</P>
  <P>
   This information is vital if we are to understand the distribution 
   and abundance of species and habitats; without it, making informed 
   decisions on how to protect the UK&#146;s wildlife is much more difficult.</P>
  <P>
   Whilst a huge amount of information exists, it is held in a variety 
   of formats by many different organisations, which means that it 
   isn&#146;t always easy to access. The National Biodiversity Network 
   (NBN) however, is making as much of the information as possible 
   available to everyone who needs it and one way it does this is 
   through its website - the NBN Gateway. The NBN Gateway quite simply 
   acts as a &#147;data warehouse&#148; for biodiversity information, 
   which can be quickly and easily accessed to understand the 
   distribution of particular species in the UK. Individual records, 
   covering plants, mammals, birds and invertebrates, are stored on the 
   NBN Gateway and these can then be displayed on a map of the UK in a 
   number of different ways. </P>
