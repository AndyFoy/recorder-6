  <P>
   A <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">biotope</SPAN> is defined* as:</P>
  <P CLASS="Quote">
   &quot;a particular area which is substantially uniform in its 
   environmental conditions and flora and fauna.&quot;</P>
  <P>
   A <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">habitat</SPAN> is defined* as:</P>
  <P CLASS="Quote">
   &quot;the particular environment inhabited by a particular living 
   organism. The environment thus described comprises the whole complex 
   of fauna, flora, soil and climatic factors to which the organism is adapted.&quot;</P>
  <P>
   Thus <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">biotope</SPAN> focuses on the 
   nature of an area whereas <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">habitat</SPAN> 
   focuses on the relationship of a particular organism to its 
   environment. However, the term &quot;habitat&quot; is often extended 
   to cover the environment inhabited by a community of organisms and 
   the two terms become virtually synonymous.</P>
  <P>
   Since the majority of classification systems dealt with in biological 
   recording attempt to classify areas of land, often based on their 
   vegetation and environmental conditions, and sometimes their fauna as 
   well, the term &quot;biotope classification&quot; is more appropriate 
   than &quot;habitat classification&quot;.</P>
