   XML is a method of putting structured data into text files. It is a 
   set of rules for designing text formats for data which are easy to 
   generate and read (by a computer), unambiguous and avoid common 
   pitfalls like platform-dependency and lack of extensibility. Version 
   1.0 is a standard that has been ratified by the World Wide Web Consortium.
