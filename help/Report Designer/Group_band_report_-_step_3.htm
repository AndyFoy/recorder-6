   Group band report 3</H1>
  <H3>
   Linked group bands</H3>
  <P>
   Within each location, we want the observations grouped by date. To do 
   this we need to add another group band and make Sample Date its 
   controlling field. But, in addition, we need to link it with the 
   existing band controlled by location.</P>
  <P>
   To see why this is necessary, consider the following observations 
   sorted by location and date:</P>
  <P>
   <TABLE WIDTH="36%" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0">
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Location 1</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Date 1</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Location 1</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Date 1</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Location 1</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Date 2</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Location 2</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Date 2</TD>
    </TR>
   </TABLE></P>
  <P>
   If we set up two group bands controlled by Location and Date we would 
   see the following bands printed:</P>
  <P>
   <TABLE WIDTH="60%" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0">
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="20%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Location 1</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       1st Group band prints</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="20%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Date 1</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       2nd group band prints</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="20%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Date 2</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       2nd group band prints because date has changed</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
     <TD WIDTH="20%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       Location 2</TD>
     <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP>
      <P>
       1st Group band prints because location has changed</TD>
    </TR>
   </TABLE></P>
  <P>
   However, the 2nd group band won't print again, following Location 2, 
   because the date hasn't changed.</P>
  <P>
   We can get over this by linking the second group band to the first, 
   What this does in effect is to &quot;reset&quot; the linked band to 
   start again from scratch when its parent band is triggered. If the 
   2nd group band were linked to the first, we <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">would</SPAN> 
   see the result we want:</P>
