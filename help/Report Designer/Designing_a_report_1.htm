   Before you start.</H3>
  <P>
   Before you can design the report layout, you must run the Report 
   Wizard to select the data that you want to show. Be careful to 
   include all information that you want in your final report. It is 
   also important that you select the &quot;<A HREF="..\Topics\Report_Wizard_Layout_Selection.htm">New
    layout</A>&quot; option within the Report Wizard rather than the 
   &quot;Use existing Layout &quot; option. Otherwise you will be unable 
   to create a new layout</P>
  <P>
   Once you have finished using the Report Wizard, you should have a 
   filter screen that looks something like this one:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="Filter result and menu.gif" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   You can go back into the Report Wizard, as many times as you like to 
   select and re-select data until you are happy with the filter.</P>
  <P>
   Then, go to the bottom left-hand corner of the screen and select the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Print
    - Design and Print Report</SPAN> option. This will open the <A HREF="Designing_a_report_2.htm">Report
    designer</A>.
