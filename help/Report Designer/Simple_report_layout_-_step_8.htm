   The completed layout looks like this:</P>

   <IMG SRC="completed layout.gif" WIDTH="771" HEIGHT="369" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <H3>
   You can:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Save it for future use by selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">File
     - Save as...</SPAN> from the menu. You will be prompted to give the 
    report template template a name. By default templates are stored in 
    the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">\Recorder 6\User Files\Templates</SPAN> 
    directory and have a &quot;.tpl&quot; extension.</P>
   </UL>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">TIP:</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN>uses long file names, and this is the name you will use to 
   recognise this report in future. It is worth typing a suitably 
   descriptive name so that you, and others, will recognise the report 
   in future.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE: </SPAN>You <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">MUST</SPAN> 
   document the attributes and sort order selections which should be 
   made to re-use this report in future. If you do not select the 
   correct fields, then the report may not work at all, or missing 
   fields will appear blank. If you have used group-bands, then the 
   order in which observations are sorted is critical for the group 
   bands to work correctly. If the report is for your own use, you 
   probably will not remember these details in a few months time. If it 
   is for others to use, you must let them know which selections to make.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Print the report by selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">File 
    - Print...</SPAN> from the menu.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Preview the printed appearance by selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">File
     - Print Preview...</SPAN> from the menu. Once you are in the <A HREF="..\Topics\Report_Wizard_Print_Preview.htm">Print
     Preview</A> screen you can see what the report would look like, send 
    it to the printer or save it as a file in a variety of other formats.</P>
