   Overview</H3>
  <P>
   Plotting a distribution map is a very good way of checking for 
   unusual observations which are outside the normal range. These may, 
   of course, be caused by errors in the spatial references given to 
   Survey events and Samples making this one of the tools you might use 
   for data cleaning. However, it is then necessary to locate the 
   original observation(s) that gave rise to the distribution symbol in 
   question in order to investigate it further. This facility provides a 
   means of going straight to the observations which gave rise to a 
   distribution symbol.</P>
  <H3>
   To find observations from a distribution map symbol:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When the Map Browser is showing a distribution map, choose the Symbol 
    selection tool:
    <UL>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Map - Find 
     Source Data</SPAN> from the menus<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Click the <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\SelectSymbol.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
     button in the toolbar</P>
    </UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The cursor will change to <IMG SRC="..\CursorImages\SelectSymbolCursor.gif" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="29" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click on a distribution map symbol (i.e. a filled or hollow circle)</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If the distribution map symbol is based on a single observation, the 
    Observation window will open with the relevant observation (a Survey 
    event, Sample, Taxon occurrence, Biotope occurrence depending on what 
    was mapped) selected.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If the distribution map symbol is based on more than one observation 
    then you will see a list of the observations:</P>
   </UL>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\ScreenShots\SelectSymbolsMultipleObservations.gif" WIDTH="351" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Select one of these observations and click [OK]. The Observation 
    window will open with the relevant observation selected.
