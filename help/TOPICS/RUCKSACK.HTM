   The Rucksack is a handy container in which you can keep frequently 
   used items. It consists of a series of lists in which you can keep 
   Taxon names, Biotope classes, Locations, Names &amp; Addresses and 
   References. You can save a rucksack to disk, and quickly switch from 
   one to another. When you are entering data, or selecting items on 
   which to report, the rucksack provides a handy source from which 
   frequently used items can be obtained.</P>
  <P>
   For example, suppose you were entering data for a particular survey. 
   You could set up a rucksack containing the names of the most 
   frequently recorded species, the locations which were surveyed and 
   the people who did the sampling. If you have this rucksack open while 
   you fill in record cards, most of the data items you need can be 
   dragged from the rucksack into recording cards without having to 
   search through all the items in the database. See <A HREF="Adding_or_Deleting_Items.htm">adding,
    deleting and ordering items</A>.</P>
  <P>
   Rucksacks are stored in plain text files, consisting of lists of 
   record keys, so they can easily be shared between people who are 
   working on the same type of data. See <A HREF="Saving_and_Loading_Rucksacks.htm">saving
    &amp; loading rucksacks</A>;</P>
  <P>
   The Taxon lists in rucksack files can be used as the source of 
   species lists upon which to base recording cards. See <A HREF="New_Recording_Card.htm">setting
    up a new recording card</A>.</P>
  <P>
   Taxon and biotope lists from a rucksack file can also be used to 
   select the items on which to report. See Report Wizard <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Biotope_Selection.htm">biotope</A> 
   and <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Taxa_Selection.htm">taxon</A> selection.</P>
  <P>
   You can <A HREF="Export_rucksack.htm">export</A> a Rucksack to 
   produce a file in NBN transfer format (XML) containing a collection 
   of Locations, Names and addresses and Documents.</P>
