        Select a checklist from those available in the Taxon dictionary. If a 
        rucksack is open when the Report Wizard is started there will be two 
        additional options at the end of the drop down list: &quot;Current 
        Rucksack&quot; and &quot;Current Rucksack (Expanded)&quot;. Selecting 
        one of these will allow you to select items from the taxon list in 
        the open rucksack.</TD>

        This works like the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Find </SPAN>dialog.
         Type a name, or part of a name here, and all matching names are 
        shown in the &quot;Available&quot; list. If you type part of a name 
        (e.g. &quot;hel&quot;), then the &quot;Available&quot; list will 
        contain all names in the selected checklist or rucksack <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">starting
         with</SPAN> what you typed. If you prefix it with &quot;*&quot; 
        (e.g. &quot;*hel&quot;), then all names <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">containing</SPAN> 
        this string will be included. You can use <A HREF="Abbreviated_species_names.htm">5-letter
         abbreviations</A> for species names but they need to be preceeded by &quot;*&quot;.</P>
       <P CLASS="note">
        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tip:</SPAN> type &quot;*&quot; at 
        the Find Taxa prompt to add all the items from the rucksack to the

        If this option is selected then all taxa are included in the final 
        report, in which case, the other controls for selecting particular 
        taxa are disabled. It is for with other selection criteria, e.g. when 
        restricting a report to observations by one or more recorders, or to 
        a bounding box.</TD>

        If you include a higher-taxon in the 'Selected List', e.g. an order, 
        family, genus, etc., this gives you the option of whether or not to 
        include all the taxa within that group in the query. For example, if 
        you include the orders Diptera and Coleoptera in the 'Selected list', 
        then if this option is ticked, all observations of beetles and flies 
        will be included in the report. If this option is not ticked, the 
        report will only include observations for which &quot;Diptera&quot; 
        or &quot;Coleoptera&quot; was specifically given as the preferred determination.</TD>
     </TR>
    </TABLE></P>
   </CENTER>
  <P>
   Move the taxa whose associated observations you need in the report 
   into the &quot;Selected&quot; list. See <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Add_Items.htm">Add</A> 
   and <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Remove_Items.htm">Remove</A> items from 
   selected list.</P>
  <P>
   You can add one or more names to the 'Selected' list, and then make 
   changes in the 'check list' and/or 'Find' part of the screen. This 
   will result in a different 'Available' list from which you can make 
   additional selections.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   Note: Users working on taxa for which lots of name changes have 
   occurred may like to know more about the dictionary translates 
   between different names on different checklists.</P>
