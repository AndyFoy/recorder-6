   Installing <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>on a 
   single, standalone computer (i.e. one not attached to a network).</H3>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6</SPAN> is a Microsoft 
   SQL Server system so users need a version of SQL Server to run it. It 
   is supported when used with:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    SQL Server 2000, or its free run-time version, MSDE, Microsoft SQL 
    Server 2000 Desktop Engine.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">SQL Server 2005, or its free run-time version, SQL 
    Server 2005 Express.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">SQL Server 2008, or its free run-time version, SQL 
    Server 2008 Express.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   If you already have SQL Server installed, you will be able to install <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN> using your existing SQL Server instance. If not, you will 
   be able to download and install SQL Server Express from a Microsoft 
   web-site then install <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6</SPAN>.
    If you are in any doubt about which version to use, please request 
   advice from the supplier of your copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder,
    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">or</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"> </SPAN>via
    the forum, <A HREF="http://forums.nbn.org.uk/index.php">forums.nbn.org.uk</A>,
    as to which version is most appropriate for you. Prior to version 
   6.14 the installation CDs had MSDE on them. The version 6.14 and 6.15 
   disks had SQL Server 2005 Express on them but later versions do not 
   contain SQL Server because different versions are available for 
   32-bit and 64-bit computers and because Microsoft upgrades may 
   necessitate using the latest version of SQL Server Express for 
   installing <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   There are standalone and network installation guides in the 
   Documentation folder on all the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN> installation DVDs and on the Recorder web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.
    They have not been updated for some time but they still contain much 
   useful information. Please refer to these for information about the 
   system requirements and installing <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN>, or request updated information via the forum, <A HREF="http://forums.nbn.org.uk/index.php">forums.nbn.org.uk</A>.
    Once SQL Server Express is installed, a standalone installation 
   basically involves inserting the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    DV</SPAN>D in your DVD drive and following the on-screen instructions.</P>
  <P>
   The installation programme should start automatically. If it doesn't:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Use Windows explorer to locate the Setup.exe file on the installation 
    DVD (it is in the root folder)<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Either double click on Setup.exe or right click and 
    choose &quot;Run as&quot;.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   If you are installing <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6</SPAN> 
   on the same computer as your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN> system, the installation process will pick up your Site 
   ID from <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN>. 
   Otherwise, you will be asked to enter your Site ID and verification 
   key. You will find these on the licence agreement you received with 
   the installation DVD.</P>
  <P>
   The standalone installation guide also contains information on 
   transferring data from <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> 
   to <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6,</SPAN> although 
   more detailed information is available on the Recorder web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.
    It also contains information on SQL Server permissions, backing up 
   the database, uninstalling <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN>, the installation folders and the registry settings.</P>
  <P>
   The network installation guide contains much information on SQL 
   Server, including:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Comparisons of the different versions of SQL Server<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Migrating from MSDE to SQL Server<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">System requirements for network installations<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">SQL <FONT COLOR="BLACK">Server permissions,

   </UL>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note:</SPAN> The standalone 
   installation DVD will not install <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN> on a network. There is a separate DVD for networked installations.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note:</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN> version 6.17 is officially supported for use with <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Microsoft
