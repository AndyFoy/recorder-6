   Types of bands</H1>
  <P>
   The Report Designer in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> 
   is a &quot;banded report designer&quot; meaning that reports are 
   built up of sections called &quot;bands&quot; which contain your 
   information. The six most commonly used types of band are described below.</P>
  <H3>
   Title</H3>
  <P>
   This prints out only once at the very start of the report. Obviously, 
   it can be used for the title, but could also be used for things like 
   your organisation's logo or letterhead, the creation date, author's 
   name, etc. Anything that only want printed once, at the beginning of 
   the report</P>
  <H3>
   Page Header</H3>
  <P>
   This is the first band that is printed on every page (above the 
   title). You can use this band to print a standard header on each page 
   such as a company logo or a date etc. You can choose whether it 
   prints on the first page or not</P>
  <H3>
   Column Header</H3>
  <P>
   This band is also printed once on every page and immediately follows 
   the Page Header. It is usually used to print column names.</P>
  <H3>
   Detail</H3>
  <P>
   The detail band normally forms the bulk of the report. One detail 
   band is printed for each row the data set generated by the Report Wizard.</P>
  <H3>
   Summary</H3>
  <P>
   This band is printed once only in each report. It follows the last 
   detail band and is typically used for printing totals, averages, etc. 
   It could also be used to print things like copyright notices that you 
   want to appear at the end of each report.</P>
  <H3>
   Page Footer</H3>
  <P>
   This band is printed at the bottom of each page of the report. It is 
   typically used to show information like the page number.</P>
  <P>
   Within each band you place the information that you want to report. 
   You can enter more than one piece of information or &quot;report 
   element&quot; in each band if you wish. Report elements include:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Fixed text</SPAN>. Text, like a 
    title, which you type directly onto the page. It appear in the report 
    exactly as you have written it.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Graphics</SPAN>. These include 
    lines, boxes, shaded backgrounds, etc. that can be drawn directly on 
    the report as well as imported image files.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Data set fields</SPAN>. Places to 
    insert information from the database that you selected using the 
    Report Wizard.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">System supplied fields</SPAN>. 
    Items like the date or page numbers which are supplied by the programme.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Calculations</SPAN>. These are very 
    similar to calculations within <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Excel</SPAN> 
    and follow similar rules.
