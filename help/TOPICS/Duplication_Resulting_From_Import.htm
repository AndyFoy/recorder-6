   Duplication resulting from import</H1>
  <P>
   When data have been imported, it is not unusual to find that 
   duplicates of some of the data items that were already present have 
   been added. For example, if a particular recorder's name and address 
   were entered independently in your copy and by the person from whom 
   you have received data, then you will have duplicate entries for this 
   name. Because these items were entered quite independently, they will 
   not have the same key, and will not be detected as duplicates by the 
   import process. They are, however, apparent to a user when the sorted 
   list of names is viewed:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\ScreenShots\Duplicate name.gif" WIDTH="385" HEIGHT="240" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   In many cases this will not actually cause too many problems, but 
   there are at least two good reasons to find and deal with such duplicates:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The information contained in the duplicated items may not be exactly 
    the same (e.g. in the example shown above, the two entries were for 
    'Dr. Stuart Ball' and 'Mr. Stuart Ball'). These differences cause 
    confusion to users who are not familiar enough with the data to know 
    whether these are actually duplicates of the same recorder, or are 
    different recorders with similar names. This problem is particularly 
    acute with duplicate location names. Quite a bit of research may be 
    necessary to determine whether or not two locations that have been 
    given the same name actually refer to the same piece of ground.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you want to generate a report based on the name (e.g. &quot;what 
    records did I receive from this person in 1999?&quot;), then you must 
    remember to find all instances of the name and include them in the 
    query criteria in order to get an accurate answer. It is very easy to 
    forget to do this or to leave out some instances (e.g. if another 
    instance of this recorder's name was 'S. Ball' it would be less 
    easily picked up).</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   It is not usually possible to simply delete duplicates, because they 
   are referred to by other items in the database. For example, an entry 
   in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Names and Addresses</SPAN> 
   table will usually have been imported, because it is referred to as a 
   recorder and/or determiner in some of the observations that were 
   imported. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN> won't 
   allow the name to be deleted while it is used by these other items. 
   Because you are not allowed to change other people's data (such as 
   data imported from another copy), you cannot even go through the 
   related items and edit them manually. However, a tool is provided to 
   automate the job.</P>
  <P>
   Duplicates can be dealt with using the <A HREF="Merge_Data_Items.htm">Merge
    data</A> items tool. This process goes through all the items related 
   to one of the pair of duplicate entries and changes them so that they 
   refer to the other. The duplicate is then deleted.</P>
