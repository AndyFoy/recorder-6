   When no other tool is selected, the map cursor is shown as a normal

    After you have used another tool, you can select the pointer by:</P>

    colour from the unselected colour to the selected colour to indicate 
    it is selected - see <A HREF="Map_Settings.htm">Changing the settings 
    or properties for a map layer</A> to change these colours. If it is <A HREF="Linking_Polygons_to_Locations.htm">linked

  <P>
   If there are several overlapping site polygons at a particular point 
   (e.g. sub-site boundaries within a site boundary), then repeatedly 
   clicking will cycle through the polygons at that point. Depending on 
   the patterns and colours used for your polygon layers it may be 
   difficult to see which polygon is selected but, it should be possible 
   to see that the boundary line has changed colour everywhere it is not 
   directly overlaid by the larger polygon. Ideally, you should draw or 
   import the largest polygon first and the smallest one last, then this 
   problem will not arise.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE:</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">MapServer</SPAN> 
   does not provide a means of 'bringing the selected polygon to the 
   front', so it may be difficult to see that a smaller polygon overlaid 
   by a larger one has been selected.</P>
