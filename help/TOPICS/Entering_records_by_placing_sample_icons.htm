   Entering records by pointing at the map</H1>
  <P>
   This facility allows you to start entering records using a Recording 
   Card by clicking at the sampling location on the map. It is only 
   available if at least one sample type has been associated with a 
   Recording Card - see <A HREF="Sample_type_term_list.htm">Sample type 
   term list</A>. If this is the case, the <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\SpList16.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   button on the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Map Browser</SPAN>'s 
   active toolbar will be enabled.</P>

    The map cursor will change to a cross-hair <IMG SRC="..\CursorImages\DrawPolygonCursor.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="27" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click on the map at the location where the sample was taken. The dot 
    at the centre of the cross hair is the point at which a spatial 
    reference will be recorded.</P>

   <P>
    The Recording Card associated with the selected sample type will open 
    with the spatial reference already filled in. If you clicked within a 
    site boundary polygon which is associated with a location, the name 
    of the location will also be filled in.</P>

   <P>
    Fill in and save the <A HREF="Entering_Data_Using_a_Recording_Card.htm">Recording
     Card</A> as normal.</P>

  <P CLASS="warning">
   If you remove, rename or delete the recording card that is referenced 
   here- you will receive an error every time you attempt to open the 
   map window. This won't stop you doing anything but it can be an 
   annoyance. </P>
