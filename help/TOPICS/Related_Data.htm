   Related data</H1>
  <P>
   This facility allows you to move from a selected data item in one 
   window to any of the other items of data in other windows to which it 
   is related. For example, you could go from a recorder's name to the 
   observations recorded by that person, or from a sample to its 
   location. The selected item filters the destination window, so that 
   it only displays the data related to that item.</P>
  <P>
   All of the main windows have a [Related Data] button at their 
   bottom-right corner. To use this button:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select an item in the window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Choose the [Related Data] button at the bottom-right corner of the window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A list will be displayed of the types of data that can be related to 
    the selected item.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select one of the types from the list, and the appropriate window 
    will be displayed with the list or hierarchy on the left containing 
    the relevant, related items only.</P>
   </UL>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: selecting an item and 
   clicking on the * on the numeric keypad on the keyboard will expand 
   that item in full.</P>
  <P>
   To return to viewing all data in the window click the [Show All] 
   button beside the [Related Data] button. This removes the filter and 
   makes all data in the window accessible again via the hierarchy, or 
   list, in the left-hand panel. It also highlights the item that was 
   selected when the [Show All] button was clicked.</P>
  <H3>
   Example 1:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select a recorder's name in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Names
     and Addresses</SPAN> window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Choose the [Related Data] button, and select &quot;Occurrences&quot; 
    from the list.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Observations</SPAN> window 
    opens showing the surveys in the observation hierarchy that contain 
    observations recorded and/or determined by the selected recorder. 
    Expand the surveys to display all the taxon and biotope observations 
    recorded and/or determined by this person.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   If there are no occurrence records related to this name, you will see 
   the following message:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\ScreenShots\No Related Data.gif" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="122" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <H3>
   Example 2:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select a sample in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Observation</SPAN> Window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Choose the [Related Data] button and select &quot;Locations&quot; 
    from the list.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"> Locations</SPAN> window will 
    open with a filter on it so that the location from that sample is on 
    view. If that particular location is part of a sub-site hierarchy, 
    the site and all its parents will be displayed, with the relevant 
    sub-site selected.</P>
