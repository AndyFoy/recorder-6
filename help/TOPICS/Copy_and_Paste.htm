   Copy &amp; Paste</H1>
  <P>
   There are two main ways in which you can use Copy &amp; Paste:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When you need to add or edit a reference to an item elsewhere in the 
    system. For example, you could copy the name of a location from the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Location</SPAN> 
    window, and paste it into the location prompt of a record card.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When you want to exchange information between <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     </SPAN> and another application. For example, you may already have a 
    site description in a word-processor file which you want to use in 
    the 'Location description', or you may want to copy text from<SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"> 
    Recorder </SPAN> into a document you are writing. Most <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Windows</SPAN> 
    software supports copying and pasting information, but consult the 
    documentation for the other software for details.</P>
   </UL>
  <H3>
   To Copy:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select the information you want to copy using your mouse or keyboard.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Copy the information to the Windows Clipboard. In <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     </SPAN> this can be done by:
    <UL>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Edit 
     &#150; Copy</SPAN> from the Main menu.<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Clicking the copy button <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\copy.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
     in the toolbar.<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Pressing the short-cut key &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; on the keyboard.</P>
    </UL>
   </UL>
  <H3>

   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Position the cursor at the place were you want to use it.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Paste the information from the Windows Clipboard by:
    <UL>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Edit 
     &#150; Paste</SPAN> from the main menu.<BR>

  <P>
   If the information does not appear, it could be for several reasons:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You were not successful in copying it to the Clipboard &#150; try again.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The information you are trying to paste is not appropriate at that 
    point (for example, you cannot paste a species name into a prompt for 
    a location).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The window into which you are trying to paste the information is not 
    in Edit mode.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You do not have the necessary access rights to add or change the data 
    at the place where you are trying to paste the item.</P>
