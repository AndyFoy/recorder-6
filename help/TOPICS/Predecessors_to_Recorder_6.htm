  <P>
   Microsoft DOS-based software developed by Dr Stuart Ball of the <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/JNCC.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">JNCC</A> 
   c. 1993. Recorder 3 is a relational database application written in 
   Advanced Revelation (ARev). It was used by many individual recorders 
   and organisations, including local record centres, across the UK. The 
   system is still in use, but it is no longer formally supported. 
   Recorder 3 has been superseded by <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2000/2002</SPAN> and, more recently, <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   Revelation Software withdrew all support for any ARev for DOS 
   application runing on Microsoft Vista machines in 2007. ARev has been 
   superseded by ARev32, which forms part of OpenInsight, and Recorder 3 
   would need to be upgraded to ARev32 to run with Vista.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Recorder 2000</SPAN></H3>
  <P>
   Microsoft Windows-based software developed by Dorset Software on 
   behalf of <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/JNCC.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">JNCC</A>.
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2000</SPAN> was released 
   in September 2000 as a replacement for the DOS based Recorder 3. It 
   is a relational database application which holds all its data in a 
   Microsoft Access 97 database based on the NBN Data Model.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2000</SPAN> can be 
   installed on a standalone PC or on a network.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Recorder 2002</SPAN></H3>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> was a major 
   upgrade to <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2000</SPAN>, 
   hence the change of name. A preliminary release of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN> - version 2.0.5 - came out in December 2002 and the 
   installation CD for this version was commonly referred to as the 
   'white' CD. It was followed by version 2.3.1 in December 2003 for 
   which a new installation CD<SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">was
    produced, the coloured one with a picture of a bee nectaring on a 
   cowslip on it. The latest version of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"> 
   Recorder 2002</SPAN> is version 2.3.7.8.</P>
  <P>
   To install <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> 
   you need to:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Install <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> using 
    the version 2.3.1 CD. If you don't have a copy of this CD, anyone who 
    purchased earlier versions of the system can obtain a copy free of 
    charge from John Morris at <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/JNCC.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">JNCC</A>,
     e-mail John.Morris@jncc.gov.uk.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Upgrade to version 2.3.6.5, released in July 2004.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Upgrade to version 2.3.7.8, released in March 2005.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   The upgrades are available from the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN> section of the <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4598"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   web site</A>. Depending on the power of your PC and the speed of your 
   network, where appropriate, upgrading to version 2.3.6.5 may take 
   upwards of one hour because it is adding a lot of information to the 
   taxon dictionary, including 12 new checklists. The upgrade to version 
   2.3.7.8 adds another 11 checklists to the taxon dictionary but it 
   does not take nearly as long.</P>
  <P>
   Please refer to the associated <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">release
    notes</SPAN> for details of the changes in a particular release and 
   for additional instructions, e.g. after upgrading to version 2.3.6.5 
   and to 2.3.7.8 it is necessary to rebuild the taxon indexes.</P>
  <P>
   The size of a Microsoft Access 97 database, and hence the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN> database, is limited to 1 GB and <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/JNCC.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">JNCC</A> 
   have estimated that this means the capacity <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN> is approximately one million observations. The 
   biological recording community needs a system with greater capacity 
   so JNCC have developed <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6</SPAN>,
    a SQL Server system. In a licensed installation of SQL Server the 
   size of the database is more or less unlimited. It will only be 
   constrained by the capacity of the hardware available.</P>
