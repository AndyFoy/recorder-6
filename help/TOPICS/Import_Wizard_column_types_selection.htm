   </TABLE></P>
  <P>
   The column selection page of the import wizard enables you to specify 
   the type of data in each column in the import file. To do this:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click on the drop-down arrow in the Type row for a column.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select the appropriate type for the data in the column. The most 
    commonly used types are listed initially. If the type you require is 
    not listed, click &lt;more options&gt; to see the full list of 
    available column types - see the table of supported columns in <A HREF="Import_Wizard_data_format.htm">Data
     Format</A> for details.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you don't want to import the data in a particular column, select 
    &lt;skip this column&gt;.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   If the first row of the data to be imported contains column names, 
   tick the box next to that option. The Import Wizard will try to guess 
   the types of columns from their names. You can still edit the types 
   of any columns that the Wizard guesses incorrectly. The number of 
   observations being imported is displayed in the bottom left corner.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: You need to select a 
   Type for <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">all</SPAN> the columns to 
   be imported. Any columns with a type of &lt;skip this column&gt; will 
   be ignored.</P>
  <P>
   If you chose to use a template saved after a previous import, the 
   column types that were saved will be re-applied provided that the 
   column names are still the same.</P>
  <P>
   When you have completed specifying the type of data in each column 
   click [Validate Columns]. If errors are found a count of them will 
   appear at the top, the rows containing the errors will be shaded <FONT COLOR="FUCHSIA"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">pink</SPAN></FONT> 
   and the invalid data will be shaded <FONT COLOR="RED"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">red</SPAN></FONT>.
    You won't be able to proceed, i.e. the [Next] button won't become 
   active, until all the errors are cleared. If you float the cursor 
   over a <FONT COLOR="RED"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">red</SPAN></FONT> 
   box, a message will appear giving some information about the error.</P>
  <P>
   In the grid you can:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Edit the invalid data by clicking in a particular cell and typing a 
    new value. Once you move away from that cell, the change will be 
    saved. Until that point, pressing &lt;Esc&gt; will restore the cell 
    to its original value.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select a single row by clicking the row number in the left most column.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Remove selected rows using the [Remove Selected Rows] button at the top.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Filter on selected rows by ticking the &quot;Show selected rows&quot; 
    box at the top.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Filter on rows containing errors by ticking the &quot;Show rows with 
    errors&quot; box at the top. When this filter is on a row will 
    disappear from the grid when all the errors in it are cleared.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Sort by the values in a particular column by clicking the header, 
    i.e. by clicking in one of the shaded boxes in the row below the Type 
    row. Clicking once sorts them into ascending sequence, clicking again 
    sorts them into descending sequence and clicking in the box below 
    &quot;Type&quot; returns them to their original sequence, row number sequence.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   To select multiple consecutive rows, select the first one then hold 
   down the &lt;Shift&gt; key and select the last one.<BR>
   To select multiple rows that aren't consecutive, select the first one 
   then hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key and select the others in turn.<BR>

   Correcting Problems</H2>
  <H3>
   Column Types</H3>
  <P>
   The only mandatory column is Species Name but there are rules for 
   certain other column types, e.g.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    For <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Observer(s)</SPAN>: &quot;If 
    present, there must be a value for every observation and the wizard 
    will ask you to match them to <A HREF="Individuals_and_Organisations.htm">individuals</A> 
    in the Name and Address list. If not, the wizard assumes all 
    observations are by the same observer and asks you to enter one on 
    the page where you enter other required data that is not in the 
    import file.&quot;</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    For <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Specimen Numbe</SPAN>r: &quot;If
     present, <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Specimen Type </SPAN>must 
    also be present.&quot;</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   See the table of supported columns in <A HREF="Import_Wizard_data_format.htm">Data
    Format</A> for details.</P>
  <P>
   If the data being imported contravenes any of these rules, 
   information to help you resolve the problem will appear at the end of 
   the text on the left, along with other tips on what needs to be done 
   before you can proceed. The [Next] button won't become active until 
   all the issues are resolved.</P>
  <H3>
   Errors</H3>
  <P>
   When you click [Validate Columns] <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   validates the data in each column according to its type. All errors 
   have to be cleared before you can proceed. As you clear the errors, 
   the number at the top will decrease. The errors illustrated above are 
   typical of the types of errors found at this stage of the wizard, i.e.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Invalid dates:
    <UL>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Pre 2006 is not a valid <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
      </SPAN>date, i.e. it isn't a standard date or a date in any of the <A HREF="Vague_Dates.htm">vague
      date</A> formats supported by <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.
      It should be changed to &quot;-2005&quot;.<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">31/06/2006 and 1/17/2006 should perhaps be changed 
     to 30/06/2006 and 1/11/2006 respectively.</P>
    </UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Invalid grid references: GB grid references must be two letters 
    followed by an even number of numeric digits. Irish grid references 
    must be one letter followed by an even number of numeric digits.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A location must be accompanied by a grid reference.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A number of fields are a fixed number of characters in the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     </SPAN>database, e.g. Location and Location Name - see the list of 
    supported columns in <A HREF="Import_Wizard_data_format.htm">Import 
    Wizard - data format</A> for details. When the data being imported 
    exceeds the number of characters that can be stored in a field it 
    will be flagged as an error so that the you can abbreviate it 
    appropriately rather than have the system truncate it without 
    warning. This doesn't apply to many of the comments as they are 
    &quot;Memo&quot; fields which means they can contain large amounts of data.</P>
   </UL>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: When you have cleared 
   all the errors you will need to validate the data again using the 
   [Validate Columns] button.</P>
  <P>
   Other types of errors will be detected during the <A HREF="Import_Analysis.htm">Analysis
    phase</A>, e.g.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Dates that are outside the date range allowed for the <A HREF="Surveys_General_Tab.htm">survey</A> 
    to which the observations are to be imported.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Grid references that are outside the <A HREF="Surveys_Geography_Tab.htm">bounding
     box</A> for the survey to which the observations are to be imported.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Grid references that are outside the <A HREF="Location_Grid_Squares_Tab.htm">grid
     squares</A> for the locations to which the observations are to be linked.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   You may like to check for these types of errors, particularly for 
   dates being outside the range allowed for the survey, before 
   attempting to import a file.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: Correcting errors and 
   removing records in this screen does not make any changes to the 
   original data file. The changes are only to the copy of that file 
   taken at the beginning of the import process.</P>
  <P>
   Once all issues have been resolved, the [Next] button will become 
   active. Click on the <A HREF="Import_Wizard_missing_data_selection.htm">[Next]</A> 
   button to move to the next screen.
