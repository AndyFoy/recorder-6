   Dictionary Upgrades</H1>
  <P>
   Upgrades for the dictionaries will periodically become available and 
   will need to be included in your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   database so that you can enter observations using up-to-date 
   taxonomic checklists and biotope classifications. Taxon dictionary 
   upgrades may be required, for example, as a result of new species 
   being recorded for Britain, or in response to changes resulting from 
   research into taxonomy.</P>
  <P>
   When a dictionary upgrade for <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   becomes available it will be announced on the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN>Forum, part of the <A HREF="http://forums.nbn.org.uk/index.php">NBN
    Forum</A>, which can also be accessed from the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.
    You are advised to check this from time to time for news of upgrades 
   and other information about <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   To upgrade the<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">dictionaries
    </SPAN>you need to use the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Dictionary
    Upgrade Kit</SPAN> which first became available in version 6.9 of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.
    It&nbsp;was introduced so that changes to the dictionaries could be 
   done independent of changes to the software. Prior to version 6.9<SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">,</SPAN> 
   upgrades to the software and all the dictionaries were combined.</P>
  <P>
   Dictionary upgrades come in the form of upgrade files or scripts that 
   need to be placed in the Dictionary Upgrade Kit's Scripts folder 
   prior to running the DictionaryUpgrade.exe file. The dictionary 
   upgrade does the database changes specified in the files in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">\Dictionary
    Upgrade Kit\Scripts</SPAN> folder. When an upgrade completes, it 
   stores the most recently applied file name (excluding the extension) 
   in the <A HREF="Accessing_the_Database_from_Other_Software.htm"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> database</A>.
    This is the dictionary version that can be displayed using <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Help
    - About Recorder 6</SPAN>. It is used to prevent you from skipping 
   upgrades or running them out of sequence.</P>
  <P>
   Users are advised to backup their database prior to upgrading via <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><A HREF="Backups.htm">Tools
    - Database Tools - Backup Database</A></SPAN> or the SQL Server 
   tools they use for backups.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: Whenever an upgrade is 
   to be installed, it should be done through an <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">administrator
    user account</SPAN> to avoid any potential problems due to limited 
   user account access rights. The &quot;sa&quot; login or a trusted 
   connection with database owner privileges over the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   database is required during the upgrade.<BR>
   </P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   If you are upgrading a standalone copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   on your personal computer running Windows XP, the way you normally 
   login will probably provide sufficient rights to run an upgrade, but 
   if you are operating on a network this may not be the case and you 
   may need to ask a system administrator to run the upgrade for you. If 
   you are running Vista or Windows 7, you will need to request 
   elevation by taking the actions specified below.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: If an upgrade adds 
   large lists to the dictionary or makes extensive changes to existing 
   lists, it may take a long time to run, however this doesn't apply for 
   upgrades 0000000F to 0000000Y. In this case, you may be advised to 
   run the upgrade overnight, although the runtime will depend on the 
   power of your computer(s) and the speed of your network, where applicable.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   A large dictionary upgrade will require a lot of processing power to 
   run and therefore you may receive a message in the title bar of the 
   &quot;Recorder Dictionary Upgrade&quot; window saying that the 
   application is not responding, or it may appear blank. PLEASE DO NOT 
   CANCEL THE UPGRADE AT THIS STAGE. Press &lt;Ctrl-Alt-Del&gt; and open 
   Task Manager. Under the Applications tab the status of the 
   &quot;Recorder Dictionary Upgrade&quot; will also be displayed as not 
   responding, however, if you click on the Performance tab, the CPU 
   Usage will probably be nearing 100% and the CPU Usage history line 
   will be at the top of the grid box. Unless the CPU Usage is low and 
   static, the upgrade is still running. If you run <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN>on a network, then you will need to monitor CPU usage both on 
   the server and local machine to check that the upgrade is still 
   running. The upgrade splits it's time between the two and therefore 
   the local machine may become inactive whilst the server continues to 
   process the upgrade.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: If you are using a 
   free run-time version of SQL Server you need to keep an eye on the 
   size of your <A HREF="Accessing_the_Database_from_Other_Software.htm"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> database</A> 
   as large dictionary upgrades can add significant amounts of data to 
   it. With MSDE the maximum database size is 2 GB, with SQL Server 2005 
   Express it is 4 GB, with SQL Server 2008 Express it is 10 GB. If data 
   entry or a dictionary upgrade would take you over this, SQL Server 
   simply doesn't do it.</P>
  <H3>
   To upgrade <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">the dictionaries:</SPAN></H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Download the dictionary upgrade kit <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">from
     </SPAN>the <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4615">Dictionary Downloads</A> 
    section of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> web 
    site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>,
     <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">if this hasn't been done for a 
    previous upgrade, or if a new version is now available</SPAN>. It is 
    recommended that you store this in a folder outside your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     6</SPAN> folder(s).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Unzip the dictionary upgrade kit. Clicking on the &quot;.zip&quot; 
    file will usually open the extraction software on your computer. You 
    need to select the options that will unzip the selected file to a new 
    folder in the same location and retain the folder structure when the 
    file is unzipped (often the defaults). If extraction software is not 
    available, you will need a suitable software tool, such as <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</A>,
     to extract the files from the &quot;.zip&quot; file. The unzipped 
    file should look like:</P>

    Download the required upgrade file(s) from the <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4615">Dictionary

     It is recommended that you store them in a folder outside your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder

   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Unzip each upgrade file in turn and place the unzipped file(s) in the 
    Scripts folder in the dictionary upgrade kit. The files you download 
    are called, for example, Rec6Dict_0000000R_UnzipMe.zip, which 
    contains the files 0000000R.ini and 0000000R.zip. It is 0000000R.ini 
    and 0000000R.zip that need to be in the Scripts folder not 
    Rec6Dict_0000000R_UnzipMe.zip. Depending on the nature of the 
    upgrade, the scripts will be .zip files (usually accompanied by .ini 
    files) or .sql files. If the Scripts folder contains any 
    Rec6Dict_000000... files when dictionary upgrade is run, it won't run 
    correctly and it can prevent subsequent upgrades from running.</P>

     <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">:
      The downloaded files must be unzipped just once, so for example, </SPAN>0000000R.zip<SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;"> 
     must not be unzipped again as the upgrade kit is designed to cope 
     with it in this format. </SPAN>Do not rename any of these files.</P>

     <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">:
      For the upgrade to run correctly there must be a Scripts folder 
     containing the scripts to be run in the D</SPAN>ictionary Upgrade Kit<SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;"> folder.</SPAN></P>
    <P STYLE="text-align : left;" CLASS="note" ALIGN=LEFT>

      - About Recorder 6</FONT></SPAN><FONT COLOR="BLUE">) to the latest 
     one you wish to apply. The upgrade kit expects to apply the scripts 
     in file name sequence. It will not run a script if the previous one 
     hasn't been run and an appropriate error message will be displayed if 
     an upgrade file has not been run, e.g. if the dictionary version is 
     0000000Q but the Scripts folder contains 0000000S.ini, 0000000S.zip 
     and 0000000T.sql, then an error message will be displayed when the
