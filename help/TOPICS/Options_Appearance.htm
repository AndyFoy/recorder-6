   Options Appearance</H1>
  <P>
   The options on this tab affect the colours used in the application 
   and other aspects of the appearance of the screen. The [Undo] button 
   allows you to change your mind, and restores the settings that were 
   in force when the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Options</SPAN> 
   window was opened.</P>
  <P>

  <H3>
   Mandatory fields</H3>
  <P>
   The [colour selection] button allows you to choose a colour which 
   will be used as the background colour for mandatory fields. Select 
   white if you wish to turn this feature off. The example on the right 
   allows you to assess whether a colour is suitable. Dark colours do 
   not work well because it is difficult to read the text.</P>
  <H3>
   Information transfer colours</H3>
  <P>
   The 'Disable Information Transfer Colours' checkbox allows you to 
   turn off the facility to have coloured borders around controls 
   between which you can drag and drop information.</P>
  <P>
   The [Information source] and [Information destination] colour 
   selection buttons allow you to select the colours used for the 
   borders of such fields.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Information sources are fields from which information can be dragged.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Information destinations are fields where it can 
    then be dropped.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Some fields can be both a source and a destination, and have a dashed 
   border with both colours. The examples on the right allow you to 
   assess whether your chosen colours are suitable. Some combinations 
   may not work well for some users.</P>
  <H3>
   Application background</H3>
  <P>
   Use this option to select whether the background should be plain or 
   should consist of a bitmap.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you choose a plain background, then its colour is that set in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Windows
     Control panel</SPAN> under <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Display 
    properties &#150; Appearance</SPAN>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you choose to use a bitmap, then the <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\ellipses.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    button opens a standard <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Windows 
    file selection</SPAN> dialog to load a suitable image file. The 
    selected image will be repeatedly applied (like a tile) to form a 
    continuous background.</P>
   </UL>
  <H3>
   Show tool tips</H3>
  <P>
   This option selects whether or not tool-tips appear. Tooltips are 
   short help messages which appear when the mouse cursor hovers over a 
   control. They are helpful to new users, but can eventually become 
   irritating to experienced users.</P>
