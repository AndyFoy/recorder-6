   Obtaining digitised maps</H3>
  <P>
   Although digitised maps (both vector and raster) and satellite 
   photographs are freely available in the USA, in Britain and most of 
   the rest of Europe they are not, and must be purchased. The cost of 
   digital maps has probably been the main constraint that has prevented 
   much wider use and availability of Geographical Information Systems (<A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/GIS.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">GIS</A>).</P>
  <P>
   It is worth searching American web sites. High quality, 
   ortho-rectified satellite images of Europe, including parts of 
   Britain, can be found for free download. There are freely available 
   digital maps covering the whole world (e.g. coastal outlines, admin. 
   boundaries, roads, rivers, etc). These are usually based on 
   Lat./Long. or UTM co-ordinate systems.</P>
  <P>
   In Britain and Ireland, the main supplier of large scale maps is the 
   Ordnance Survey. Their web site contains information on products, 
   prices and availability. The series of 1:50,000 and 1:10,000 map 
   tiles are probably of most interest to biological recorders (1:25,000 
   are not yet available electronically). However, there are many other 
   suppliers for smaller scale maps covering the whole country or 
   substantial regions. Bartholemew, Harper-Collins and the AA all have 
   web sites where you will find details of digital maps. There are many 
   agencies who offer services in producing and supplying 
   ortho-rectified aerial photographs and satellite images.</P>
