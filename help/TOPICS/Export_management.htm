   This facility allows you to export data from one or more surveys or 
   taxonomic groups more easily than by using the other <A HREF="Export.htm">Export</A> 
   methods. It is particularly useful for users who are contributing 
   data to others on a regular basis, e.g. for users who are regularly 
   contributing data from several surveys to their local record centre, 
   or data from one or more taxonomic groups to a national recording 
   scheme. To use it you create a filter which you then use to do 
   exports. If the export is always to be e-mailed to the same person or 
   organisation you can set up a recording scheme to automatically 
   e-mail the exported data to a specified e-mail address.</P>
  <H3>
   Export filters</H3>
  <P>
   The <A HREF="Export_filters.htm">Export filter</A> specifies what is 
   to be exported, e.g. all observations in a selection of surveys, or 
   all herptile observations.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Export filters are saved so that they can be used to do an export 
    many times.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Export filters can be created and then sent to another user. This 
    means that someone can work out what data they need, and send a 
    filter to the data supplier who can then use it to export the 
    required data.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Export filters can also be used as the basis for a Recording Scheme.</P>

   Filters are created by selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools
    - Export Management - Manage Export Filters</SPAN> from the Main 
   menu - see <A HREF="Export_filters.htm">Export filters</A> for more 
   details, including how to use a filter to export data.</P>

   Recording Schemes</H3>
  <P>
   Quite often, an export of observations needs to be sent to the same 
   person on a regular basis, e.g. new and changed bird observations 
   needing to be sent to the county bird recorder once a month. To 
   facilitate this process a <A HREF="submit_to_a_scheme.htm">Recording Scheme</A> 
   can be set up which specifies the <A HREF="Export_filters.htm">Export filter</A> 
   to be used, the export type to be used and the e-mail address that 
   the data is to be sent to. The monthly submission can then be made 
   more easily. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> uses 
   the export filter to locate the required observations then it exports 
   only those which have been entered or changed since your last 
   submission to a file of the specified export type. The resulting file 
   is then <A HREF="..\Glossary\Winzip.htm">zipped</A> and e-mailed to 
   the specified e-mail address. The time and date is automatically 
   recorded, so that only new and changed information is sent next time.</P>
  <P>
   Recording schemes are set up by selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools
    - Export Management - Manage Recording Schemes</SPAN> from the Main 
   menu - see <A HREF="submit_to_a_scheme.htm">Submitting observations 
   to a scheme or organisation</A> for more details, including how to 
   use a recording scheme to export data.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   Note: If an export filter is not specified, the export works on the 
   whole database.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note:</SPAN> Exports done using <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools
