  <P>
   The standard reports are available <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">via</SPAN> 
   the <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Select_Report_Style.htm">Report Wizard</A> 
   if you select 'Use existing layout' in the <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Layout_Selection.htm">Layout
    Selection</A> screen. They are shown at the top of the list of

   produced by the Report Wizard when you choose 'Taxon records' or 
   'biotope records' in the first page of the Wizard (under <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Select_Report_Style.htm">Select

   then grouped by location, and the date and determiner are shown for 
   each observation together with any comment.</P>
