   Cut-In and Cut-Out scales</H1>
  <P>
   Digital maps are designed to be viewed at a particular scale. This is 
   determined by the scale of the base map that was digitised or scanned 
   to produce the digital version. While it is quite possible to use 
   them effectively over a range of scales above and below their ideal 
   scale, there comes a point in either direction at which they are no 
   longer useful.</P>
  <P>
   For example: consider an outline map of Great Britain and an OS 
   1:50,000 map tile (as supplied by the OS, these cover an area of 
   20x20km). If you view the whole of the GB outline on screen (approx. 
   700km wide and 1,200km high), then the OS tile will appear as a 
   square blob only a few pixels across. Conversely, if you zoom in so 
   that the OS tile fills the screen, the GB outline &#150; which will 
   probably have been digitised at a fairly coarse scale so that it 
   contains a manageable number of co-ordinates &#150; will probably be 
   a rather poor fit to the coast (i.e. it won't follow all the little 
   bays and inlets shown on the 1:50,000 map, but will consist of a few 
   straight line segments that follow the general shape).</P>
  <P>
   The solution is to turn off the display of the map-tile while you are 
   looking at the whole of GB, and turn off the display of the GB 
   outline while you are zoomed in on the map tile. You can achieve this 
   by setting the scales at which background map layers should 'Cut-in' 
   and 'Cut-out' in the <A HREF="Map_Options_Map_layers.htm">Map Options 
   - Map Layers</A> page. A range of scales from 1:100,000,000 to 1:1 
   are available.</P>
  <P>
   You will probably find that a degree of trial and error will be 
   necessary to establish settings which work well for a particular set 
   of maps.</P>
