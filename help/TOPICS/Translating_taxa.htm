  <P>
   Translation between lists, standard &quot;recommended&quot; names and 
   standard sort orders is provided by the Index_Taxon_List table in the 
   database. This table is partly populated by the Nameserver table in 
   the database. If you are concerned that the translations that you 
   were hoping to have are not happening it is probably because the 
   Nameserver is not fully populated. Discuss this with the Species 
   dictionary team at the Natural History Museum. Each Taxon has a 
   &quot;recommended&quot; name within the Taxon dictionary. This is 
   usually a term off one of the preferred lists.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   Note: Recommended names are a scientific names that represent current 
   taxonomic thought</P>
  <P>
   Recorder uses this &quot;recommended&quot; name to do it's translations.</P>
  <P>
   So, for instance,</P>
  <P>
   If you are reporting using the BAP species list, Recorder will;</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    1. Find out what that the currently recommenced name for each of the 
    taxa on the BAP Species list is.</P>
   <P>
    2. Then find all other taxa that share this recommended name</P>
   <P>
    3. Produce a report based on all of these terms</P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
   As you can see from this. There may be cases where complex changes in 
   terminology over time may case some unexpected results to come out of 
   the translation. Because of this, there is always the option to show 
   the original term recorded against in a report so that you can check 
   for any discrepancies</P>
