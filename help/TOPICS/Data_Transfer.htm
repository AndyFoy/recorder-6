   Data transfer</H1>
  <P>
   Data about the natural environment in the UK are, for good practical 
   and historical reasons, held in a variety of different formats on 
   different types of computer hardware and are managed by a variety of 
   software. Although, in attempting to define standards to allow 
   networked access to a range of independent distributed data sets, the 
   National Biodiversity Network (<A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/NBN.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">NBN</A>)
    is attempting to influence this situation, it is highly unlikely 
   that everyone concerned will adopt the same data structures and 
   formats. Given the wide range of purposes for which data are 
   collected and used, it would not be appropriate to expect universal 
   adoption of any one standard or approach.</P>
  <P>
   Data exchange between different databases is rarely straightforward, 
   and often requires sophisticated transfer programs to be developed. 
   If such a system was needed for every pair of databases, the exercise 
   would far exceed the resources available to the environmental community.</P>
  <P>
   The alternative is to adopt a common, intermediate format. Moving 
   data between databases then becomes a two stage process: database <B><I>A</I></B> 
   writes data from its internal format into the intermediate transfer 
   format and <B><I>B</I></B> reads the transfer format and loads the 
   data into its internal format. These processes can be separated in 
   time and space and require no physical connection between <B><I>A</I></B> 
   and <B><I>B</I></B>. The big advantage comes when <B><I>C</I></B> 
   wishes to join in. The designers of <B><I>C</I></B> can design their 
   system to read and write the intermediate format and immediately 
   communicate with <B><I>A</I></B> and <B><I>B</I></B> without having 
   to have any knowledge of their internal structure. As more players 
   join, the benefits become greater for all concerned.</P>
  <P>
   Whatever mechanisms exist for the transfer of information between 
   databases, data exchange cannot be meaningful unless the information 
   they contain is compatible. There are two important areas:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Logical rules for the structure and relationships within the data.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Interpretation of terminology.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   This is not meant to imply that the structure and terminology used by 
   different databases must be the same (although that provides the 
   simplest situation for data transfer). Two databases could, for 
   example, hold information about designated sites consisting of a 
   name, a spatial reference, area, reason why the site was selected and 
   date it was designated, etc., but could store it quite different ways 
   (e.g. one might store the spatial reference as an OS grid reference 
   whilst the other used latitude and longitude). One might contain 
   details not held by the other (e.g. ownership and management 
   information about such sites). Despite these differences, the 
   information they hold in common could be exchanged.</P>
  <P>
   Standardisation is clearly desirable in some areas, and transfer is 
   much simpler between databases that rely on the same terminology. 
   However, transfer is still possible between databases that do not 
   share the same structure and terminology, provided the intermediate 
   format includes sufficient information to allow unambiguous 
   interpretation. For example, the transfer format for a spatial 
   reference needs to include information about which spatial reference 
   system was used (OS grid, lat./long.).</P>
  <P>
   Not all databases will be able to deal with all the information that 
   is transferred. For example, the database which does not store 
   information about designated site ownership will simply ignore that 
   information in a transfer file. Because it is impossible to predict 
   all the types of data that might eventually need to be covered, the 
   transfer format should be extensible.</P>
  <P>
   In summary, the data exchange format should:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be sufficiently flexible to cover all types of information that might 
    be present in environmental data sets;</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be extensible so that novel categories of data can be accommodated;</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be independent of any particular software;</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be independent of the physical medium used for transmission;</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be independent of any particular language-related character set, and 
    the character sets used, including punctuation characters used in the 
    format definition itself, should be re-definable within the exchange language;</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be capable of being stored in a format that can be easily manipulated 
    by standard software tools (e.g. plain text files) and be 
    intelligible in its own right;</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be structured so that meaningful data can be generated from databases 
    that do not contain the full range of data dealt with by the standard 
    as a whole.</P>
   </UL>
