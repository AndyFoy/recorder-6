  <P>
   The Taxon Indexes let <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">make
    use of the complex taxon dictionary more quickly and effectively.</SPAN></P>
  <H2>
   I<SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">ndex Taxon Group</SPAN></H2>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">This supplies information about 
   which taxa are included within higher taxa in the taxonomic 
   hierarchies in checklists. For example, it tells the system which 
   families, genera, species and sub-species are in the order 
   &quot;Diptera&quot;. This allows </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;"> to report on higher 
   level taxa easily and efficiently.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   You can:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">Use higher level taxa in the 
    Report Wizard and, optionally, have all the taxa within them included 
    in the report. See <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Taxa_Selection.htm">Report 
    Wizard - Taxa Selection</A> for details.</SPAN></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">Drag a taxon onto the Map window 
    to get a distribution map for all the taxa within it. Again, you will 
    be given the option of mapping all taxa within the group, or </SPAN>only
     including observations for which the taxa was specifically given as 
    the preferred determination.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Set up your own higher-level groups which contain an arbitrary 
    collection of taxa at any level. For example, you might want to set 
    up a group &quot;Waterbeetles&quot; which includes a mixture of 
    families, sub-families and genera. This is achieved through the <A HREF="Edit_Taxon_Group.htm">edit
     taxon group</A> page. You can then drag &quot;Waterbeetles&quot; on 
    to the Map window to produce a distribution map of all waterbeetles, 
    or include it in the Taxon Selection of a report.</P>
   </UL>
  <H2>
   Index Taxon Name</H2>
  <P>
   This supplies a number of very important elements for each taxon 
   including it's sort order, recommended name, common name etc. Index 
   Taxon Name is inherent to the way in which <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> <A HREF="Translating_taxa.htm">translates
    </A>between items on different checklists and provides standard 
   names and sort orders for entries.</P>
  <H2>
   Making use of the indexes</H2>
  <P>
   If you import a new checklist (e.g. from an XML file) or through an 
   update you will need to rebuild the indexes</P>
  <P>
   Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools - Database Tools - 
   Rebuild Taxon Group Index</SPAN> from the Main menu.</P>
  <P>
   Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools - Database Tools - 
   Rebuild Taxon Name Index</SPAN> from the Main menu.</P>
  <H2>
   Index Taxon Synonym</H2>
  <P>
   This index no longer has a particular role and is included because 
   certain add-ins make use of it. If you do not have nay of these 
   add-ins you do not need to worry about this index</P>
