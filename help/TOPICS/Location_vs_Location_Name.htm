   Location and Location Name</H1>
  <P>
   Within <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> there are 
   two separate concepts for holding the name of a location: 'location' 
   and 'location name'. Both of these concepts can be defined at the <A HREF="Survey_Events_Overview.htm">survey
    event</A> level and the <A HREF="Sample_Overview.htm">sample</A>, as 
   illustrated in this screen shot of a sample:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\ScreenShots\Sample General Location.gif" WIDTH="454" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   There is a tendency for collators to define a formal <A HREF="Location_Overview.htm">location
    hierarchy</A> into which all observations are associated and, in 
   some cases, this hierarchy may actually be sent out to recorders to 
   encourage them to associate their observations in the same way. The 
   primary reason for doing this is that it eases reporting (for example 
   a query such as show me all observations associated with a particular 
   location becomes easier). However, there are a couple of risks with 
   this approach:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Different recorders may have different interpretations of where the 
    site is, for example where the boundary actually runs</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Many observations may not be associated with the location even though 
    they do occur within it. This can occur where the recorder was not 
    aware that the observation was made within a particular site. Where 
    this occurs, using the location hierarchy for reporting can be very unreliable.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Generally, it is better to use the location name concept, except 
   where the observations are genuinely associated with a known and well 
   defined location (most typically where the same site is regularly 
   being revisited (for example as part of a monitoring programme). 
   However, location name can be used with a location from the location 
   hierarchy to provide more information about the location of an 
   observation, as illustrated above.</P>
  <P>
   In summary use:</P>
  <P>
   '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Location name</SPAN>' where the 
   attribute is text describing the location where an observation was 
   made, usually in addition to a spatial position (e.g. a grid 
   reference). Typical values might be 'Field west of Monks Wood' or 'By 
   entrance to reservoir on Kingwood Common'. This can be very useful 
   when verifying the grid reference associated with the record or 
   helping to identify the true grid reference if it has been 
   incorrectly recorded or entered. In some cases the text may refer to 
   a genuine recognised location (e.g. 'Monks Wood') but generally it is 
   preferable to simply record the information as a 'location name' if 
   in doubt.</P>
  <P>
   '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Location</SPAN>' where the 
   observation is associated with a known, and previously defined, 
   location for which you want to store the type of information that is 
   held in the location hierarchy such as alternative names, a detailed 
   description, designations, measurement data, etc. Typically this 
   should be used when the same site is being visited repeatedly and 
   there is a requirement to ensure that all the separate samples are 
   formally 'tied together' in the Recorder database. Most typically 
   this would be used for repeated monitoring data. The [Get] <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\find.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="22" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   button located next to location prompts indicates that this field can 
   be entered using one of the methods for <A HREF="Finding_Things.htm">finding
    things</A> to get a location from the location hierarchy.<BR>
   </P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tip</SPAN>: Locations can be linked 
   to administrative areas using the <A HREF="Location_Administrative_Areas_Tab.htm">Administrative
    Areas tab</A> on the Geo Info tab in the location hierarchy. 
   Observations not linked to locations can be linked to administrative 
   areas using the <A HREF="Sample_Administrative_Areas_Tab.htm">Administrative
    Areas tab</A> on the sample.</P>
