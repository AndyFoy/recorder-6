   The Preferred lists</H2>
  <P>
   To aid users, those checklists that are most useful for entering 
   current observations have been grouped together at the beginning of 
   the drop down list. The names of these lists are preceded by the 
   name, in CAPITAL LETTERS, of the taxonomic group they cover. They are 
   the '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Preferred</SPAN>' lists. When 
   entering data for multiple taxonomic groups, users can simplify, and 
   hence speed up, data entry by restricting searches for taxa to just 
   these lists by setting 'Restrict Taxon Searches to:' '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Preferred
    Checklists</SPAN>' on the General tab in <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><A HREF="Options_General.htm">Tools
    - Options</A></SPAN> or on the <A HREF="Finding_taxa.htm">Find Taxon</A> 
   dialogue box.</P>
  <P>
   If in doubt about which list to use in the dictionary, you are 
   advised to set Restrict Taxon Searches to '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Preferred
    Checklists</SPAN>' and allow <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   to select taxa from the appropriate list. Alternatively, users could 
   use the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Recorder 3.3 (1998)</SPAN> 
   checklist as it includes most taxa found in the field and is 
   therefore a good general purpose list for data entry. However, as the 
   date indicates it is now rather old and it may not contain all the 
   taxa you require, in which case it will be necessary to select from 
   another list. For example, if you are recording fungi you may find 
   that the species for which you want to record observations are not on 
   the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Recorder 3.3 (1998)</SPAN> 
   checklist. In this case you should use the FUNGI&amp;LICHEN British 
   Mycological Society GB Checklist of Fungal Names, the preferred list 
   for fungi and lichen.</P>
  <H2>
   Status and legislative lists</H2>
  <P>
   Status and legislative lists, e.g. Priority Species List (2007), Red 
   Data Book and Wildlife and Countryside Act lists, are included in the 
   Taxon Dictionary for reporting purposes. These lists cannot be used 
   for data entry. If you try to select a taxon from one of them when 
   entering data you will receive a message saying 'The taxon selected 
   is from a species list that is inappropriate for data entry purposes. 
   Please choose a taxonomic checklist to select the taxon from.'</P>
  <P>
   Using these lists, a report can be produced, for example, for all 
   taxa on the Priority Species List (2007), i.e. for the UKBAP species. 
   If required it can be restricted to various dates, locations, 
   recorders etc.</P>
  <H2>
   Other lists</H2>
  <P>
   A number of other lists have been included in the Taxon Dictionary 
   for historic reasons or because they are needed for data entry but 
   are not classed as preferred lists. Some of them are exact 
   replications of published checklists; they are not edited and do not 
   necessarily contain a hierarchy or common names, unless in the 
   published list. Long lists that are not arranged in a hierarchy are 
   cumbersome to use as they take significantly longer to open than 
   other lists.</P>
