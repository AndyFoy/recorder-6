   How spatial references are stored</H1>
  <P>
   Internally, spatial references are converted to latitude and 
   longitude co-ordinates in degrees, and are stored as a pair of 
   floating point numbers. However, the original string that was entered 
   by the user is also stored. This allows information about the 
   precision of the original co-ordinate to be derived. It can also be 
   used to check for rounding errors that might arise if co-ordinates 
   were repeatedly converted between co-ordinate systems.</P>
  <P>
   Five fields are always stored:</P>
  <CENTER>
   <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
    <TABLE WIDTH="90%" CELLPADDING="7" CELLSPACING="1" BORDER="1">
     <TR>
      <TD WIDTH="36%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Spatial_ref</SPAN></TD>
      <TD WIDTH="64%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        The string entered by the user (this is 'cleaned up' before storage 
        &#150; e.g. letters are forced into upper case, extra spaces are trimmed).</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD WIDTH="36%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Lat</SPAN></TD>
      <TD WIDTH="64%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        Latitude in degrees.</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD WIDTH="36%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Long</SPAN></TD>
      <TD WIDTH="64%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        Longitude in degrees.</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD WIDTH="36%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Spatial_ref_system</SPAN></TD>
      <TD WIDTH="64%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        This identifies the system that is used to covert to and from the 
        value that was entered by the user to the stored lat/long (e.g. OSGB).</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD WIDTH="36%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Spatial_ref_qualifier</SPAN></TD>
      <TD WIDTH="64%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        Information obtained from the user about how the spatial reference 
        was obtained (e.g. 'estimated from map').</TD>
     </TR>
    </TABLE></P>
   </CENTER>
  <P>
   If a table stores more than one spatial reference, these field names 
   are prefixed with a label indicating their purpose.</P>
