   A set of CDs has been produced containing the full set of 1:50,000

   Registered <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;"> 
   users can licence just those tiles they wish to use. The process has 
   been set up to allow licences to be obtained either by E-mail, or by 
   post for those who don't have access to, or don't wish to use, 
   electronic communications (but note that there is a small additional 
   handling charge for postal orders):</SPAN></P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">The Map browser software is 
    installed from the first CD. To install the software, you must agree 
    to the terms of the licence agreement between NBN and OS.</SPAN></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">On first running the Map browser, 
    you are prompted to set up an account with the administrator at the 
    NBN secretariat. This involves filling in you contact details (name, 
    e-mail address, postal address, etc.) in an on-screen form which is 
    posted or e-mailed to the administrator (with your first order for tiles).</SPAN></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">You can then choose the tiles you 
    wish to licence. The Map browser generates an order by e-mail, or it 
    can be printed and posted to the administrator.</SPAN></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">You pay the licence fees either by 
    ringing up and paying via a credit or debit card, or by posting a 
    cheque with the printed order form.</SPAN></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">Once payment has been received, 
    the administrator generates &quot;unlock keys&quot; which are 
    specific to your copy of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     200</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">2 and the particular 
    tiles you requested. These keys are e-mailed or posted back to you, 
    depending on how your order was received.</SPAN></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">When you receive the unlock keys, 
    you run the Map browser software again and it reads the e-mail, or 
    prompts you to type in the unlock keys from the letter.</SPAN></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">The software will then prompt you 
    to insert the relevant CD and will install the chosen tiles into your 
    copy of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">.</SPAN></P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">If you order tiles by e-mail and 
   pay by credit or debit card over the phone, it should be possible to 
   gain access to a given tile almost immediately during normal office hours.</SPAN>
