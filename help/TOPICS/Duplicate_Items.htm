   Duplicate items</H1>
  <P>
   Duplicate items often arise when a <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   user exports data to another user on a regular basis. Consider a 
   volunteer recorder who has their own copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   and uses it to contribute observations to their local record centre. 
   Whenever a user exports a set of observations, the export file will 
   contain all the data related to those observations, so it will 
   contain the Surveys, Survey Events and Samples containing the 
   observations, the Name &amp; Address entries related to them 
   (e.g.entries for that volunteer and perhaps some other people who 
   they working with or who have checked identifications), any Locations 
   related to them and any user added term-list items related to them. 
   When you import a file from them for the first time, all of this 
   related data will be added to your copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.
    Next time the same volunteer sends you a set of observations, the 
   export file is quite likely to contain many of the items that were in 
   the previous import, as it will probably contain more observations 
   observed in the same places and by the same people.</P>
  <P>
   The system of <A HREF="NBN_Globally_Unique_Identifiers.htm">Globally 
   Unique Identifiers</A> developed for the National Biodiversity 
   Network (<A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/NBN.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">NBN</A>)
    allows the import process to detect when it already has a copy of an 
   item that is present in the import file. So, for example, the 
   volunteer contributor will have created an entry for their own Name 
   &amp; Address which will have a unique identifier - say 
   'VOL00001000000D7', and this will have been imported as part of the 
   first import file. When the next import file is submitted, it will 
   most likely contain the same Name &amp; Address entry again. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   will detect that it already has a Name &amp; Address item in its 
   database with this key and flag it as a Duplicate Item. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   will not allow you to have duplicate items within your database, so 
   it forces you to choose one of the two options available.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: It is important to 
   realise that detecting duplicates is entirely based on the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">key</SPAN> 
   (Globally Unique Identifier), <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   will not look at the content of the entry at all.</P>
  <P>
   The import process reports that it has two items with the same key - 
   it does not check whether data elements are duplicated (i.e. a 
   location already present with the same name and spatial reference 
   will not be detected as a duplicate if it has a different key).</P>
  <P>
   The detection of duplicates allows you to replace an item with an 
   edited or corrected version of it so that if the volunteer changes 
   something, the change can be incorporated into your system. Perhaps 
   an identification or a grid reference was entered incorrectly, and is 
   then corrected after exporting the incorrect version to you. If the 
   next export file contains the correction, the corrected items will be 
   detected as Duplicates, because their keys are already present, but 
   the data is actually different because of the correction it contains.</P>
  <P>
   To enable you to detect which is the latest of a pair of duplicates, 
   nearly all rows that <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   stores in the database have a pair of date stamps called ENTRY_DATE 
   and CHANGED_DATE:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    ENTRY_DATE is set to the (time and) date at which the row was created.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">CHANGED_DATE is updated to the current (time and) 
    date whenever a change is made to the row.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   There are three things you can do with these incoming rows for which 
   you already have copies:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Accept the imported item and allow it to over-write the item that is 
    already present.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Reject the imported item and keep the item that is 
    already present in the database.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Compare the date stamps on the two items and only 
    overwrite the current copy if the incoming copy has a more recent 
    date. That way you make sure you have the latest version.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   So if the import process finds rows amongst the incoming data with 
   keys that it already has in the database, then these are shown in the 
   Duplicate Items tab and you must decide what to do with them:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\screenshots\Import duplicate items.gif" WIDTH="905" HEIGHT="660" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The list of Duplicate Data is hierarchical with the table name at the 
   top level and the keys at the next level down. If you select a key, 
   the Imported Data and Original Data panels show the contents of the 
   fields so that you can compare them and see the differences. The 
   panels show the name of the table from which an item comes at the top 
   level, followed by the column names and then the actual data. These 
   display the raw data in a format that is not very user friendly, so 
   you probably won't want to spend much time delving for the differences!</P>
  <P>
   Your options from this point are provided by the row of buttons which 
   allow you to choose between the various ways of dealing with 
   Duplicate Items:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    [Accept Import] or [Reject Import] work on one row at a time and 
    allow you to make a decision about the currently selected row. You 
    can of course examine the date stamps in the Imported Data and 
    Original Data panels if you want to know which is the most recent 
    copy. The selected item will disappear from the Duplicate Data panel 
    after clicking one of these buttons.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The [All Imported], [All Original] and [All Latest] buttons allow you 
    to make a single decision for the whole batch of data: to overwrite 
    everything with the incoming data ([All Imported]), to ignore the 
    imported rows and keep the copies you already have ([All Original]), 
    or to compare date stamps and import rows only if they are more 
    recently changed ([All Latest]).</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   You can combine these two strategies and deal with some rows one at a 
   time with the [Accept Import] or [Reject Import] and then use one of 
   the 'All ...' buttons to deal with the remainder.</P>
  <P>
   If you are uncertain about which option to choose, it is recommended 
   you use the [All Latest] button to import updated rows. You will 
   often find that you get a message saying that a decision cannot be 
   made about all items because some don't have both date stamps (e.g. 
   Sample_recorders), so press [All Imported] or [All Original] to mop 
   up the remainder. Which of these you choose probably depends upon how 
   much you trust the source of the import!</P>
  <P>
   Once you have made a decision about all the Duplicate Items, the [Do 
   Import] button will become active. Press this button to complete the 
   import and copy the imported rows into your database. See <A HREF="Import_Analysis.htm">Analysis
    and Import</A> for more information.</P>
