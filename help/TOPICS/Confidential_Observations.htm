   Individual observations can be marked as <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Confidential</SPAN>.</P>

   If an observation is flagged as Confidential:</P>
  <UL>

   <P>
    It cannot be viewed by users with an access level below 'Full-edit'</P>

    It cannot be exported by anyone unless a systems manager has ticked 
    the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Enable export of confidential occurrences</SPAN> 
    option on the General tab in <A HREF="Options_General.htm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">Tools

    It will not appear in reports unless you specifically indicate that 
    confidential observations should be included (<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Reports
     &#150; Wizard &#150; Additional filters &#150; </SPAN><A HREF="Additional_Filters_Contraints.htm">Constraints</A>).
     This option is only available to those users with 'full-edit' access 
    or above.</P>

  <P>
   The Confidential flag can be used to protect 'sensitive' observations 
   where it is thought that environmental damage might occur if the 
   information became more widely known.</P>
  <P>
   It might also be used to make sure that work in progress is not 
   accidentally reported or exported. For example, if a survey is 
   undertaken under contract, it may be specified that the information 
   is not released until the work is completed and the contractor's 
   permission has been given.</P>
  <P>
   Confidential observations can only be exported by users with full 
   edit privileges.</P>
