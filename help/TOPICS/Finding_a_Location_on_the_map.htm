   To find a Location, Survey event or Sample on the map:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Right click on a Location in the Location window, or a Survey event 
    or a Sample in the Observation window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select &quot;Find On Map&quot; from the pop-up menu that appears.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The Map Browser will open, or come to the top if it is open already, 
    with the map positioned so that the selected item is at the centre.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A hint will be shown briefly, over the map, indicating the position 
    of the spatial reference it has moved to.</P>
   </UL>
  <H3>
   Notes:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If the Location is associated with a polygon, the map will zoom to an 
    appropriate scale to show the whole polygon and the polygon will be 
    selected (this will be the first polygon associated with the Location 
    if there are more than one). Otherwise the map will just be 
    repositioned at its current scale.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If the Survey event or Sample is not associated with a Location, the 
    map will centre at its spatial reference.
