   Validating data</H1>
  <P>
   When entering data into <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   it is validated using a Standard Validation Library. Many checks are 
   done such as checking that dates are valid <A HREF="Vague_Dates.htm">vague
    dates</A>, that <A HREF="Spatial_References_Overview.htm">spatial references</A> 
   are valid for the selected spatial reference system (Tools - Options 
   - Spatial References) and that, taxa, biotopes, locations, 
   individuals, organisations and documents exist in the the appropriate 
   list or hierarchy. Checks are also done for consistency, e.g. that 
   the dates of observations are within the allowed date range for the <A HREF="Surveys_Overview.htm">survey</A> 
   to which they are to be added, and that the spatial references are 
   within the bounding box of the survey. However, there are 
   circumstances in which data can become invalid. A common example of 
   this is when editing dates for observations. If a survey event, its 
   samples and its taxon determinations all have dates of, say, 
   12/05/2008 but then a user changes the date in the survey event to, 
   say, 19/05/2008 without changing the dates in the samples, the 
   samples become invalid because their dates are no longer equal to or 
   within the survey event dates. If sample dates are changed but not 
   the taxon determination dates of the observations in them, the taxon 
   determinations will become invalid if their dates are <FONT COLOR="BLACK">no
    longer equal to or after their sample date. Similarly with location 
   data, the sample spatial reference must be equal to or within the 
   survey event location, i.e. within the grid squares of the survey 
   event location.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   Invalid items can easily go unnoticed but will cause problems when 
   exchanging data between systems. When importing data, it is validated 
   using the Standard Validation Library and invalid items are not 
   imported - see <A HREF="Invalid_Items.htm">Invalid Items</A> for more information.</P>
  <P>
   In 2008, new facilities were introduced to help prevent items from 
   becoming invalid and to detect any existing ones:</P>
  <H3>
   Editing dates and location data</H3>
  <P>
   When editing dates and location data in <A HREF="Survey_Events_General_Tab.htm">survey
    events</A> you have the option to cascade the change through the 
   samples in the event.<BR>
   When editing dates and location data in <A HREF="Sample_General_Tab.htm">samples</A> 
   you have the option to change the survey event at the same time, and 
   the other samples in the same event.<BR>
   In the case of changing dates the change can also be cascaded through 
   the determinations.</P>
  <P>
   To use this facility, <A HREF="Editing_an_Item.htm">edit the item</A> 
   as normal and make the required changes. If a date, location, 
   location name or spatial reference has been changed, a dialogue box 
   like this will appear when you click [Save].</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\Cascade event changes.gif" WIDTH="506" HEIGHT="271" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   These options appear when editing the date in a survey event. Select 
   your desired option:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Do Nothing</SPAN> - only does the 
    change in the item you have selected for editing.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Update all the child samples and 
    determinations to match the survey event's updated Date</SPAN> - 
    changes the date in the survey event, all its samples and all their determinations.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Update the child sample and 
    determinations to match the survey event's updated Date but only if 
    the values previously matched between the sample and survey event or determination</SPAN> 
    - changes the date in the survey event, its samples and 
    determinations but it only changes dates in samples and 
    determinations which were the same as the event date beforehand.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Click [OK] to update the database and make the changes permanent.</P>
  <P>
   When editing sample data an additional option is available: <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Also
    update all samples and determinations within the same survey event 
   using the same rules</SPAN>.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: the second and third 
   messages will vary depending on whether you are editing a survey 
   event or sample and on whether you are editing a date, location, 
   location name and/or spatial reference.</P>
  <H3>
   Revalidating items</H3>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If at any time you are concerned that your system may contain invalid 
   data you can revalidate all data in a selected item:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   To revalidate a <A HREF="Surveys_Tags_Tab.htm">survey tag</A>, i.e 
   all surveys with a particular tag, a <A HREF="Observations.htm">survey</A>,
    survey event, sample, taxon or biotope occurrence:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Select the required item in the observation hierarchy.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Right click and select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Revalidate Record</SPAN> 
    from the pop-up menu that appears.</P>
   </UL>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If the revalidation doesn't find any invalid items the system will 
   respond saying 'The database validation was successful.'</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If the revalidation finds invalid items the system will display a box 
   that lists the invalid items with a message to say why the item has 
   failed validation. It will also offer two options:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    [Save Details] - allows you to save the details of the invalid items 
    in a file that can be opened in Notepad, Word, Excel or similar 
    software. It can also be used as a filter that can be loaded to 
    enable you to view the invalid items at a later date as when you 
    select [View Results].</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    [View Results] - places a filter on the window concerned so that the 
    invalid items are on view when items are expanded by clicking on the <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\TreePlus.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0" LOOP="0"> 
    beside them. The invalid items will be highlighted and a message 
    saying what is wrong with them will appear when you float the cursor 
    over them. To remove the filter click [Show All] to the bottom right 
    of the window.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">For details of how to load a 
   saved filter and the format of a filter file, see <A HREF="Loading_filters.htm">Loading
    filters.</A></SPAN></P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: other user added data, 
   such as locations, can be revalidated in the same way.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: this facility is only 
   available to System Managers - see <A HREF="User_Access_Levels.htm">User
    access levels</A>.</P>
  <H3>
   Revalidating data selected by the Report Wizard</H3>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   To revalidate the observations in the report wizard's filter result 
   go through the steps involved in <A HREF="Using_the_report_wizard.htm">using
    the wizard</A> as normal until you are at the filter result. At this point:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Click the [Report Output] button.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Revalidate Items.</SPAN></P>
   </UL>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If the revalidation doesn't find any invalid items the system will 
   respond saying 'The database validation was successful.'</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If the revalidation finds invalid items the system will display a box 
   that lists the invalid items with a message to say why the item has 
   failed validation. It will also offer the two options above: [Save 
   Details] and [View Results].</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: this facility is only 
   available to System Managers - see <A HREF="User_Access_Levels.htm">User
    access levels</A>.</P>
  <H3>
   Revalidating the entire database</H3>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   To revalidate the entire database:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools - Database Tools - 
    Revalidate Database</SPAN> from the Main menu.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    You will then be warned that this may take some time and you will be 
    asked if you want to continue.</P>
   </UL>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If you say Yes the validation will proceed and when it is complete, 
   if any invalid items have been found, the system will display a box 
   that lists a summary of them along with the options to [Save Details] 
   or [View Results] as above.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: this facility is only 
   available to System Managers - see <A HREF="User_Access_Levels.htm">User
    access levels</A>.</P>
  <H3>
   Revalidating data to be exported</H3>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   When data is exported e.g. for importing into another <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   system - see <A HREF="Export.htm">Export</A> for details - it is 
   revalidated prior to export. If invalid items are found a message 
   saying 'There are invalid records in the data you are about to 
   export. These records will not be exported. Do you wish to continue?' 
   If you say Yes the export will be done then, regardless of whether 
   you said Yes or No, a filter will be loaded to enable you to see the 
   invalid items.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: selecting an item and 
   clicking on the * on the numeric keypad on the keyboard will expand 
   the item in full.</P>
