   Date validation</H1>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Entries must be valid dates. For example, 31/11/1999 or 29/2/1999 are <FONT COLOR="RED">not</FONT> 
    valid dates.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    In most circumstances, dates after today's date are not acceptable. 
    You cannot specify that an observation was made, a specimen was 
    determined, or a site was designated at a date in the future! There 
    are a few exceptions to this: for example, you are allowed to set the 
    end date for a survey into the future.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Where 'From' and 'To' dates are used, the date given in the 'From' 
    prompt must be before the date given in the 'To' prompt.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Dates must be consistent with each other. For example, if you gave 
    start and end dates for a survey, then dates given for the survey 
    events and samples within that survey must be between the start and 
    end dates you specified for the whole survey.</P>
   </UL>
  <H3>
   Troubleshooting</H3>
  <P>
   If you are having problems with dates that appear perfectly valid 
   being rejected, check the Regional settings in your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Windows</SPAN> 
   control panel, since this is where <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Windows</SPAN> 
   programs get the information on how to <A HREF="Two_Digit_Years.htm">interpret
    dates</A>. The two most likely problems are:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The order of elements (day, month, year): For example, 31/3/1999 may 
    or may not be valid, depending on the expected ordering of elements. 
    If your Regional settings are for the American pattern of 'm/d/y' 
    (i.e month number, then day number, then year) then this is not a 
    valid date, but if the settings are for the European pattern 'd/m/y', 
    then it is valid.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The Regional settings also specify the separator to be used between 
    each element. If you selected 'English (British)' or 'English (United 
    Kingdom)' in the 'Regional settings' tab, and have not changed the 
    default, the separator will be &quot;/&quot;.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Another possible problem is inadvertently setting a date into the 
   future because of the way that years entered with one or two digits 
   are <A HREF="Two_Digit_Years.htm">interpreted</A>.</P>
