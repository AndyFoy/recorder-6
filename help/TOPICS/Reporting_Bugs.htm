   Reporting Bugs</H1>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If you encounter a bug or error in the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   software or documentation, the developers would like to know about 
   it. A &quot;bug&quot; is defined as &quot;any problem found in the 
   software that is solved by changing the source code of the software&quot;.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   Bugs and <A HREF="Unhandled_Errors.htm">unhandled errors</A> should 
   be reported on the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>Forum,
    part of the <A HREF="http://forums.nbn.org.uk/index.php">NBN Forum</A>.
    <A HREF="Upgrading.htm">Upgrades</A> to fix bugs will be made 
   available via the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   When reporting a bug, please try and provide as much detail as 
   possible on the circumstances, the sequence of actions that led to 
   the problem, the symptoms that occur and the operating environment. 
   The following checklist may be useful:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    The version of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
    software and any components it is using. Use <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Help
     - About Recorder 6 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">from 
    the main menu to obtain </SPAN>this information.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    The operating system you are using, e.g. Windows XP, Vista, Windows 
    7, Windows Server 2003.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    The version of SQL Server you are using - see <A HREF="Installing_on_a_single_machine.htm">Installing
     on a single machine</A> for the list of versions supported.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    The specification of the machine - what sort of CPU, how much RAM, 
    whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit, etc.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    The sequence of actions you performed which led to the error. Please 
    try and describe these as accurately, and in as much detail as possible.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    A description of the problem including a note of any error messages 
    that were reported. Note: if you get an <A HREF="Unhandled_Errors.htm">unhandled
     error</A>, from <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6</SPAN>,
     it saves the details in a text file. Include a copy of this file if 
    you are reporting a bug.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Is it reproducible? (If you carry out this sequence of actions again, 
    do you get the same error?). Errors that are not reproducible can be 
    very hard to track down and fix!</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    Depending on the nature of the problem, it may be helpful to supply 
    copies of the data you were using at the time, e.g. if you 
    encountered an error whilst doing an import, then it would be very 
    useful to supply a copy of the file you were trying to import when 
    the problem arose.</P>
