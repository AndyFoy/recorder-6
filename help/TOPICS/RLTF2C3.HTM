   Recording Cards overview</H1>
  <P>
   Many national recording schemes and surveys adopt 
   physical recording cards to record observations of taxon or biotopes 
   at a particular location. These physical recording cards are 
   represented electronically in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN>. Their purposes are:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To present the user with a familiar format for 
    recording multiple observations.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To provide an efficient method of rapid data entry for 
    taxon at a location.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To allow additional information to be easily recorded, 
    such as a taxon count.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To allow customisation, so that users can set up and 
    use any number of cards for specific surveys (and transfer them 
    to/from other users).</P>
   </UL>
  <P  >
   For many users, the recording card represents the most 
   efficient method for entering multiple taxon observations for a 
   location. For a single taxon observation, the <A HREF="Species_Card.htm">Enter
    a species observation</A> should be used.</P>
  <P  >
   The information on a recording card is stored as a new <A HREF="Sample_Overview.htm">sample</A> 
   for the selected <A HREF="Surveys_Overview.htm">survey</A>. Where the 
   sample is stored depends on the location, date and recorder for the 
   recording card. If a <A HREF="Survey_Events_Overview.htm">survey event</A> 
   already exists with the same location, date and recorder as the 
   recording card, then the card is added as a new sample for that 
   event. However, if no matching event exists, a new survey event is 
   created, and the card added as a new sample for this event.</P>
