   Spatial References</H1>
  <P>
   The geographical co-ordinate for a position on the Earth&#146;s 
   surface can be specified in a wide variety of different systems. Some 
   (like Latitude and Longitude, and UTM) are global, whilst others are 
   local in scope (like National Grid systems).</P>
  <P>
   Recorder supports multiple spatial reference systems and four are supplied:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <A HREF="OS_National_Grid_for_GB.htm">Ordnance Survey National Grid 
    for Great Britain</A>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <A HREF="OS_National_Grid_for_Ireland.htm">OS National Grid for Ireland</A>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <A HREF="Latitude_and_Longitude.htm">Latitude and Longitude</A>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <A HREF="UTM_Co-ordinates.htm">Universal Transverse Mercator</A> (UTM).</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Additional systems can be supported by <A HREF="Install_Addin.htm">Add-Ons</A>.</P>
  <P>
   Spatial references can be entered using any supported system and, 
   internally, all spatial references are stored as latitude and 
   longitude co-ordinates. See <A HREF="How_Spatial_References_are_Stored.htm">How
    spatial references are stored</A> for more details.</P>
  <P>
   The currently selected spatial reference system is used to format 
   spatial references for display on screen and for reporting. However, 
   it is not always possible to convert the lat./long. co-ordinate into 
   the currently selected format. For example, suppose Irish grid 
   references and the lat./long. co-ordinates for offshore observations 
   had been entered, and the current system was 'OS National Grid for 
   Great Britain'. These references may be outside the area covered by 
   the GB national grid and, therefore, cannot be shown as GB grid 
   references. In these cases, the original spatial reference is shown 
   as <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">BEYOND SYSTEM LIMITS</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   Another piece of information which is stored alongside the spatial 
   co-ordinates, is the way in which the information was obtained 
   (spatial reference qualifier).</P>
  <P>
   Examples include:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Estimated from map.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Obtained from internal map.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    GPS.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Site centroid.</P>
   </UL>
