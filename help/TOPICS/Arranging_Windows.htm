   Arranging windows</H1>
  <P>
   When a particular window is opened for the first time within<SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"> Recorder</SPAN>,
    the screen display size will be dependent upon its resolution, and 
   the overall size of the application's window. Consequently, not all 
   the controls may be visible.</P>
  <P>
   You can re-size the window by dragging its edges or corners with the mouse.</P>
  <P>
   However, you may find that the relative widths of the hierarchy on 
   the left and the detail panel on the right are not as required. To 
   correct this, drag the raised double lines in the bar between the two 
   panels with your mouse.</P>
  <P>
   <IMG SRC="..\screenshots\dragsplitter.gif" WIDTH="543" HEIGHT="481" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   Adjust the size of the window and the position of the bar between the 
   two panels until it appears as required. When you close the 
   application, these settings are remembered, and next time you use the 
   application, the window should appear as you left it.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE:</SPAN> Maximising the window 
   (by clicking the maximise button <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\maximise.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="13" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   in the window title), or selecting Window &#150; Cascade from the 
   Main menu will alter the way the window is displayed. If you then 
   close the application, these new settings will be saved.</P>
