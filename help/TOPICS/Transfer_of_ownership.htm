   It is very important for version control issues that only a single 
   copy of a record is &quot;live&quot; and therefore editable. If edits 
   are possible from a variety of places, the original recorder would 
   have no control over what details were put against their name. Also, 
   if multiple versions of the same record record are around, it becomes 
   very difficult to establish what the &quot;original&quot; and 
   &quot;approved edits&quot; are and what are erroneous.</P>
  <P>
   For these reasons, records are only editable on their owners copy of 
   Recorder. By default, the owner is the originator of the record. 
   There may however be situations where ownership and editing rights 
   need to be transferred to someone else</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A recorder who has decided to stop recording may donate their dataset 
    to their local record centre or recording scheme. Obviously it is 
    appropriate for the editing rights to be passed over as well.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A contractor may do a piece of work and hand over their resulting records.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A recorder may pass their data to their county recorder for inclusion 
    in a collated database and be happy to pass ownership as well.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   In such cases, it is possible to transfer ownership to the 
   appropriate copy of the programme.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   Note:If Users give away ownership of their data, they will lose the 
   ability to edit those records. This can only be returned to them by 
   the person they have given the ownership to.</P>
  <P>
   To transfer ownership you need to know the 8 figure Site ID or copy 
   identifier of the copy of Recorder you are transferring ownership to;</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Open Recorder 6 (the copy of the programme that you are transferring
