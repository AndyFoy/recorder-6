  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 6</SPAN> is the leading 
   biological recording software for naturalists. It allows them to 
   capture their observations of fauna and flora and habitats in an 
   electronic format that is compatible with the <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/NBN.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">NBN</A>.
    It also allows sets of records to be exchanged between copies and to 
   be submitted to organisations associated with the NBN.</P>
  <P>
   The <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> project is led 
   by <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/JNCC.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">JNCC</A>,
    funded and directed by the Steering Group and informed by the User 
   group. The software was developed by Dorset Software and is supported 
   by JNCC and the <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4611">Approved

     In v6.13 this changes the determination type of the preferred 
    determination rather than adding a new determination. When changed in 
    edit mode the <A HREF="Taxon_Determinations.htm">Dets. tab</A> will 
    open with the mandatory fields already completed. <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN> 
    that the Determiner defaults to the name of the person currently

   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Species designation or status reporting</SPAN> 
    has been improved significantly. The concept of designation sets has 
    been introduced to make the selection of designations easier. When 
    using the report wizard it is now possible to restrict the 
    observations included in a report to just the species with 
    designations from a specified set or to a list of individually 
    selected designations using <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Select_Report_Style.htm">Restrict
     report to one or more Designations</A> on the opening screen of the 
    wizard. Note that the designations themselves will only appear in the 
    report if they are selected as <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Select_Attributes.htm">attributes</A>.
     Regardless of whether the report has been restricted to observations 
    for species with designations, when selecting attributes you can 
    decide what designations you want to appear in the report by 
    selecting options for designation sets. For each designation set you 
    can opt to include the Short Names, Long Names, Kind, Status 
    Abbreviation or Taxon Designated (Yes/No) for the designations. The 
    previous way of reporting on designations has been retained for the 
    benefit of those who use it. This change required 3 new tables in the 
    database: <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Taxon_Designation_Set</SPAN>,
     <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Taxon_Designation_Set_Item</SPAN> 
    and <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Index_Taxon_Designation</SPAN>. 
    The last one is another index on the taxon dictionary which will need 
    rebuilding after <A HREF="Dictionary_Upgrades.htm">dictionary upgrades</A>.
     The taxon lists to be used when rebuilding this index are stored 
    against 'TaxDesList' in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Setting</SPAN> 
    table, and the list separator to be used in reports is stored against 
    'DBListSep' in the same table.</P>

   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Survey tags</SPAN> has been added 
    to the list of attributes for a survey that can be included in a 
    report done using the report wizard. When included, all tags for a 
    survey will appear in one column as a semi-colon separated string.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">

    A new tab has been added to samples for administrative areas. 
    Previously administrative areas could only be assigned to locations 
    so there was no mechanism for recording what admin area a sample is 
    in if it isn't linked to a location in the location hierarchy. In 
    v6.14 <A HREF="Sample_Administrative_Areas_Tab.htm">admin areas can 
    be added to samples</A> by editing the sample in the observation 
    hierarchy. Note that they can't be added by the standard data entry 
    screens: <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Data Entry - Enter a 
    species record</SPAN> or <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Data Entry 
    - Enter Species for a place</SPAN>. Nor can they be added when 
    importing data using the import wizard. Both <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Select_Attributes.htm">Sample
     Administrative Areas</A> and Sample Location Administrative Areas 
    can be included in reports produced using the report wizard. This 
    change required a new table in the database: <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Sample_Admin_Area</SPAN>.</P>

    The way the Import Wizard splits the contents of the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Observer(s)

     Wood&quot;. Likewise with &quot;Richard &amp; Susan Brown&quot;. It 
    also handles names with two initials after the surname correctly so 
    &quot;Wood, Mr J.C.&quot; is interpreted as &quot;Mr J.C.Wood&quot;.

    installation DVDs for this version have been modified to make 
    installation with Windows 7 more straight forward. Different elements

    recent releases but the text files that contain the messages are 
    stored in different locations. Information at the top of a message 
    specifies where it will be saved. Multiple files can be saved with 
    names like Error-73448034840937.txt and the system automatically 
    deletes any over 7 days old. With Windows XP a typical location is 
    C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Recorder 6\Errors; with 
    Windows 7, C:\Users\Public\Documents\Recorder 6\Errors.</P>
