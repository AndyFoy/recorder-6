   Location overview</H1>
  <P>
   One of the fundamental pieces of information about a biological 
   observation is the &#145;place&#146; where the observation was made. 
   In <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>there are two 
   ideas for &#145;place&#146;.</P>
  <P>
   The first is a &#145;location&#146;, which is a named area of land 
   (or sea) to which additional information can be attached (such as 
   county, ownership, management etc.). The second is a &#145;<A HREF="Spatial_References_Overview.htm">spatial
    reference</A>&#146;. This consists of a simple grid reference or 
   latitude and longitude where the observation was made. You can also 
   store some text describing the point in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Location
    name</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;"> 
   field which appears in Survey events and Samples.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   The<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"> Locations </SPAN>window is 
   where additional information is managed for a named location. It 
   forms a fundamental screen in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN>. In addition, it is also used to hold information on <A HREF="Features_Overview.htm">Location
    features</A>.</P>
  <P>
   The overall layout of the screen is the same as the other screens in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN>, i.e. a tree view in the left panel, and a detail window in 
   the right panel which displays information about the selected item. 
   The tree view on the left displays all of the locations in the 
   database as sites or sub-sites, and these can be arranged in <A HREF="Location_Hierarchies.htm">hierarchies</A>.</P>
