   Grid references and spurious accuracy</H1>
  <P>
   Consider the following map image.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\screenshots\gbmap.gif" WIDTH="277" HEIGHT="407" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   This image is approximately 300 pixels wide and 500 high, and 
   represents an area on the ground about 800 km east to west and 1,300 
   km north to south. Therefore, an individual pixel on the screen 
   represents an area nearly 3km square on the ground. Taking this into 
   account, it is unrealistic to derive a grid reference that is more 
   precise than a 10km square (e.g. NZ16) when you click on the map to 
   obtain a spatial reference. However, the software is quite capable of 
   generating a spatial reference to the nearest metre (e,g, NZ 12345 
   67890). If this was allowed, it would be a case of 'spurious accuracy'.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN> uses the scale of 
   the map displayed in the <A HREF="The_Map_Browser.htm">Map Browser</A> 
   to calculate the size on the ground represented by a pixel. This 
   information is used to decide the appropriate precision for the 
   spatial reference that is shown when you click on the map. So, as you 
   zoom in, the spatial reference shown when you click becomes more precise.</P>
