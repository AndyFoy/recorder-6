   Survey Events</H1>
  <P>
   Survey events describe visits by surveyors to localities. A survey is 
   composed of a set of such visits, and samples are made during these 
   visits. The information recorded for a survey event details where 
   surveyors went, who took part and the date (or date range). 
   Information on conditions during the visit, and a comment to allow 
   amplification (for example, to give extra details of exactly where 
   surveyors went) can also be recorded.</P>
  <P>
   For <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">ad hoc</SPAN> observations, 
   the survey event will contain the 'where', 'who' and 'when' component 
   of a record.</P>
  <P>
   The locality can be an entry in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Locations</SPAN> 
   window, but this is not required. Alternatively a grid reference 
   could be given, preferably with some amplification in the Location 
   name field (e.g. TL291341, 2km east of Eden beside the A99).</P>
