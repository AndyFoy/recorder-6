   Sharing Recording Cards with others</H1>
  <P>
   Recording cards are a useful method of rapid data entry for a 
   particular recording scheme or national survey. Because the cards are 
   simple <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Windows</SPAN> text files, 
   they can be exchanged easily between users of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder.</SPAN> 
   Therefore, for a particular co-ordinated survey or scheme, a standard 
   recording card could be created (for example, by the scheme 
   organiser) and circulated to all contributors to promote a common 
   method of recording.</P>
  <H3>
   To transfer a recording card</H3>
  <P>
   Recording cards are stored in the recording cards directory as simple 
   text files with a &quot;.crd&quot; extension. This directory is '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">\</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : bold;">Recorder</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"> 
   6\User Files\Recording Cards'</SPAN> in a 'standard installation', 
   but can be changed using the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Options
    - </SPAN><A HREF="Options_File_Locations.htm">File Locations</A> 
   dialog box. For example, if you have created a Recording card called 
   'Common spring flowers', you will find a file called 'Common spring 
   flowers.crd' in your recording cards directory. To transfer this card 
   to other users, simply copy the file and distribute it on a floppy 
   disk or as an email attachment.</P>
  <H3>
   To use another individual's recording card</H3>
  <P>
   If you have received a recording card which was created by another 
   user, then you can easily use it in your copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Identify where recording cards are stored by looking at the recording 
    card directory in <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Options -</SPAN> <A HREF="Options_File_Locations.htm">File
     Locations</A> dialog box.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Copy the &quot;.crd&quot; file you have been sent to this directory.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When you next start <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN> 
    and go to the list of cards (<SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">via </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Data
     Entry &#150; </SPAN><A HREF="Species_Card.htm">Enter Species for a place</A>),
     you will see the additional card that you have copied.</P>
   </UL>
  <P CLASS="note">
   Note: You need to close <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   down and start it again before a new recording card will be detected 
   and made available in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Data 
   Entry - Enter species</SPAN> for a place sub-menu.</P>
