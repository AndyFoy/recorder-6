   Saving a query</H1>
  <P>
   Queries produced by the Report Wizard can be saved to disk and reused 
   in future using the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Report &#150; 
   Run </SPAN>command. Normally, a query is saved together with a report 
   layout or snapshot, so that running the report in future will do the 
   whole job (retrieve the appropriate records from the database and lay 
   them out as required). However, it is possible to save just a query, 
   without linking it to a report template or snapshot.</P>
  <P>
   Queries are saved from the <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Filter_Result.htm">Filter
    Results</A> page of the Report Wizard. After you have designed a 
   layout for the report and saved the template, you will come back to 
   the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Filter Result</SPAN> screen.</P>
  <H3>
   To save the query</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">File &#150; Save</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">as</SPAN> 
    from the Main menu.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A standard<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Windows</SPAN> 
    dialog will open, allowing you to give a name under which to save 
    this query.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   If you re-order columns in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Filter
    Result </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">before </SPAN>saving
    the report, the change is remembered in the saved report.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">TIP:</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN>uses long file names, and this is the name you will use to 
   recognise each query. It is worth typing a suitably descriptive name 
   so that you, and others, will recognise each one in the future.</P>
  <P>
   Queries are saved with a .wzd extension. By default, they are stored 
   in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Reports</SPAN> folder in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">User
    Files</SPAN> folder in the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   folder, unless this is changed for the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Queries</SPAN> 
   entry using <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools &#150; Options 
   &#150; </SPAN><A HREF="Options_File_Locations.htm">File locations</A> 
   from the Main menu, but you can use the facilities in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Save
    As</SPAN> dialog to save them to any accessible folder.</P>
  <H3>
   Saving a query without an associated report layout</H3>
  <P>
   If you attempt to save a query before you have designed a report 
   layout or defined a snapshot, you will see the following message:</P>

    dialog will be displayed, allowing you to go ahead with the save.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you run this report using <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Reports
     &#150; Run</SPAN>, you will be prompted to select a report template 
    or snapshot at that time.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
