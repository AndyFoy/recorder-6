   Edit and Browse modes</H1>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> makes a 
   distinction between 'Browse' mode, during which you are navigating 
   around viewing data, but not changing anything; and 'Edit' mode, 
   during which you are adding a new record or editing an existing one.</P>
  <P>
   This is one of the most important aspects of the system for a new 
   user to get to grips with, and remains a source of annoyance for 
   experienced users! It is very easy to start typing some change to 
   your data, only to find it is not accepted because you are not in 
   Edit mode!</P>
  <P>
   However, it was designed in this way to protect your data. The 
   underlying database, <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Access 97</SPAN>,
    is 'normally' in Edit mode, and saves changes when you move to 
   another record. If this behaviour was allowed in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN>, it would be very easy to change something 
   unintentionally (by hitting the wrong key while moving from one 
   record to another, for example). If you then move to the next record, 
   the change is committed and the original data lost for good. 
   Consequently, in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> 
   you are forced to make an explicit decision to make a change &#150; 
   even though it can be irritating at times to have to remember to do so!</P>
  <P>
   The detail panel on the right hand side of each of the main windows 
   enters Edit mode when:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You press [Add] (to add a new record) or [Edit] to make changes to 
    the currently selected record.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Edit &#150; Add</SPAN>, 
    or <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Edit &#150; Edit</SPAN> from the 
    Main menu.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <IMG SRC="..\screenshots\locations edit mode.gif" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <H3>
   How do you know that a window is in Edit mode?</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The [Add], [Edit] and [Delete] buttons on the left are inactive.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The [Save] and [Cancel] buttons in the detail panel on the right are active.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Required fields have a coloured background, if you have selected this 
    option (see <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Options &#150; </SPAN><A HREF="Options_Appearance.htm">Appearance</A>).</P>
   </UL>
  <H3>
   Once in Edit mode, to return to Browse mode:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You must ensure that all required fields contain valid data.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You can optionally enter data into other fields.</P>
   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Choosing [Save] performs any outstanding validation checks and, if 
     the data are valid, makes permanent changes to the database.<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Choosing [Cancel] abandons any changes and returns 
     the window to the state it was in before you entered Edit mode. No 
     changes are made to the database.</P>
    </UL>
   </UL>
  <H3>
   Why can&#146;t I get into Edit mode?</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If the [Add] button is inactive, you do not have sufficient access 
    rights to add data here.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If the [Edit] button is inactive, either you don&#146;t have 
    sufficient access rights to edit this record, or it is not your 
    record and, therefore, you cannot change it. This happens if data 
    have been imported from elsewhere and 'belong' to a different site.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If the [Delete] button is inactive, either you don&#146;t have 
    sufficient access rights to delete this record, or you cannot remove 
    it because other data depend on it (e.g. a sample which has 
    observations attached). You must delete the dependent data first</P>
   </UL>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE:</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN> does not allow cascading deletes. You must explicitly 
   remove dependent records before you can remove the record they depend on.</P>
