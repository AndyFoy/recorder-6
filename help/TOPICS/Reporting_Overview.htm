   <FONT COLOR="BLACK">The reporting facilities available with <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   are designed to enable you to report on your data in a variety of 
   ways, as outlined below.</FONT></P>
  <H2>
   The Report wizard</H2>
  <P>
   <FONT COLOR="BLACK">The Report Wizard is designed to provide an 
   easy-to-use way of answering three basic questions:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <FONT COLOR="BLACK">What observations have been made for given taxa?</FONT><BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">What observations have been 
    made for given biotopes?</FONT><BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P"><FONT COLOR="BLACK">What taxa and/or biotopes have 
    been recorded at a particular place?</FONT></P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   The Report Wizard leads you through the steps necessary to answer 
   these questions. The results of the Wizard include a query (written 
   in SQL - Structured Query Language) and, optionally, a report 
   template (the layout used to print information) or the instructions 
   for creating a <A HREF="Reporting-The_snapshot_tool.htm">Snapshot</A>.
    Two standard templates are available to provide a pre-defined layout 
   in which the answers to these basic questions can be presented, or a 
   built-in <A HREF="..\Report Designer\Designing_a_report_1.htm">Report Designer</A> 
   can be used to design report layouts. The query and template can be 
   saved for future use, as can a snapshot. Therefore, once a particular 
   report has been saved, it can be re-run at any time using <A HREF="Running_Reports.htm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">Reports
    - Run</SPAN></A>, and it will report on the current, up-to-date 
   state of the database. Saved reports can also be given to other <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   users so that the same reports can be produced from a number of 
   different copies of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   For more information see <A HREF="Using_the_report_wizard.htm">Report Wizard</A>.</P>
  <H2>
   Standard Reports</H2>
  <P>
   <FONT COLOR="BLACK">A number of reports are available as standard 
   facilities in the system:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Occurrences for Places Report</SPAN> 
    - lists the species and habitat observations for a selected location.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Places for Occurrences Report</SPAN> 
    - lists the observations for a selected taxon in the taxon dictionary 
    or the observations in a survey, survey event or sample in the 
    observation hierarchy.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <FONT COLOR="BLACK">To run the standard reports - see <A HREF="Running_Reports.htm">Running
    Reports</A>.</FONT></P>
  <H2>
   XML reports</H2>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>comes with an 
   extensive selection of <A HREF="XML_reports.htm">XML reports</A>, a 
   powerful addition to the reporting tools in the system. If you 
   require a report that can't be produced using the other reporting 
   facilities you may find that it is already available as an XML 
   report. Alternatively, you will be able to develop it yourself, 
   provided you have access to the necessary computing skills. These 
   reports can be run from within your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   system using one of the methods described in <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><A HREF="Running_Reports.htm">Running
    Reports</A></FONT>. They can also be designed to run from a selected 
   item in a <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> window.</P>
  <P>
   For more information on these reports, <FONT COLOR="BLACK">see <A HREF="XML_reports_supplied_with_Recorder.htm"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">XML
    reports supplied with</SPAN></A></FONT><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><FONT COLOR="BLACK"><A HREF="XML_reports_supplied_with_Recorder.htm"> Recorder</A>.

   please <A HREF="XML_reports.htm">click here</A><FONT COLOR="BLACK">.</FONT><BR>
   </P>
  <H2>
   Other Reporting Facilities</H2>
  <P>
   As well as the reporting facilities described above you can also 
   report directly on the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>database.
    This is a SQL Server database called <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NBNData_Data.MDF
    </SPAN>which, in a standard standalone installation, will be found in:</P>
  <P>
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data. Also in 
   this folder will be the associated log file, <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NBNData_log.LDF</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   As specified in <A HREF="Accessing_the_Database_from_Other_Software.htm">Accessing
    the database from other software</A>, JNCC have also made an <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Access</SPAN> 
   database - <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">nbndata.mdb</SPAN> - 
   available to enable you to query the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   database using Microsoft <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Access</SPAN>.
    If you were accustomed to using <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Access</SPAN> 
   to query your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN> 
   database, you will be able to transfer your queries to this version 
   of nbndata.mdb which links to the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   SQL Server database.</P>
  <P>
   If you have the necessary SQL Server tools, or any other software 
   capable of accessing a SQL Server or <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Access</SPAN> 
   database (e.g. a Geographical Information System or a dedicated 
   report writer) you will be able to use them for reporting and 
   analysis of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> database.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: The <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   database structure is very complex and will require time and effort 
   to master. It is based on the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NBN 
   data model</SPAN> which is documented in the Documentation Wiki on 
   the Recorder web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.</P>
  <H3>
   SQL Reports</H3>
  <P>
   In <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder 2002</SPAN>, there was 
   an add-in called <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">SQL Reports</SPAN> 
   which provided a basic library of pre-set reports written in SQL. 
   This library could be added to by writing your own SQL reports in 
   Microsoft <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Access</SPAN>. In <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN>, this functionality has been superseded by XML reports.</P>
