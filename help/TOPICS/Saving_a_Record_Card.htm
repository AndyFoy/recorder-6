   Saving the information entered using a Recording Card</H1>
  <P>
   Once you have completed a recording card, you can save the all the 
   information you have entered by clicking on [Save].</P>
  <P>
   The information on a recording card is stored as a new <A HREF="Sample_Overview.htm">sample</A> 
   for the selected <A HREF="Surveys_Overview.htm">survey</A>. Where the 
   sample is stored depends upon the location, date and recorder for the 
   recording card. If a <A HREF="Survey_Events_Overview.htm">survey event</A> 
   already exists with the same location, date and recorder as the 
   recording card, then the information is saved as a new sample for 
   that event. However, if no matching event exists, a new survey event 
   is created, and the information added as a new sample for this event. 
   A <A HREF="Taxon_Occurrence_Overview.htm">taxon occurrence</A> will 
   be created for each species you ticked in the list, and a single <A HREF="Biotope_Occurrence_Overview.htm">biotope
    occurrence</A> will also be created if you made an entry in the 
   'Biotope' prompt on the card.</P>
  <P>
   Once the card is saved, all of the observations are cleared from the 
   card, leaving the other information intact (e.g. the survey, 
   location, recorders etc.), with the exception of the sample comment. 
   This allows the user to enter another set of observations without 
   having to re-enter all the data in the heading of the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">Recording
    card</SPAN>. The comment isn't retained because it is more likely to 
   be different for each sample.</P>
