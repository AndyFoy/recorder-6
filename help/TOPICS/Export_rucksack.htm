  <P>
   When the Rucksack window is active, you can select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools
    - Export data...</SPAN> from the menu to produce an export file in 
   NBN transfer format (XML) or NBN Access Database format (ZIP) 
   containing all the items in the Rucksack lists other than the Taxon 
   and Biotope lists (these contain &quot;system supplied&quot; items 
   which are not normally exported because the recipient should already 
   have them).</P>
  <P>
   This is particularly useful facility for a Recording Scheme 
   Organised, or a Local Record Centre, who works with volunteers. They 
   can build a rucksack for a particular Survey containing the 
   Locations, Names and Addresses and Documents relating to that Survey 
   and then produce an export file which they can send to participants. 
   The volunteer can import the file into their copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;"> and they then have all 
   the reference information they need for the Survey.</SPAN></P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tip:</SPAN> In the Export dialog 
   box, you will probably want to ensure that the &quot;Include 
   observations&quot; tick-box is <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">not</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;"> 
   ticked. This will result in a file that just contains the Location, 
   Names &amp; Address and Document records, but not the actual 
   observations you hold which are associated with them. You will 
   probably want to leave the &quot;Include subsites for exported 
   Locations&quot; ticked so that the file does include any subsites of 
   the Locations you have chosen.</SPAN>
