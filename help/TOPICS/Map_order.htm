   Overview</H3>
  <P>
   If you have several map layers for a map that overlap in a given 
   geographical area, the order in which they are drawn can be an issue. 
   Think of them like a stack of sheets of paper. Whilst <A HREF="Vector_Raster_maps.htm">vector
    maps</A> such as your polygon layers are transparent and allow other 
   layers to show through, this is not the case with <A HREF="Vector_Raster_maps.htm">raster
    maps</A> or backgrounds. Raster maps cover up and hide anything that 
   is &quot;underneath&quot; them in the stack.</P>
  <P>
   For example, suppose you have an 1:50,000 map tile (a raster layer) 
   showing a site in which you are interested and you also have a more 
   detailed, 1:10,000 map tile (another raster layer) covering just that 
   site. You would probably like to arrange things so that, as you zoom 
   in on the area, the 1:50,000 map is displayed with the 1:10,000 map 
   on top of it. This is a considerable help in selecting the right area 
   to enlarge. You would set the &quot;Cut-in&quot; and 
   &quot;Cut-out&quot; scales so that the 1:50,000 map 
   &quot;cuts-out&quot; when you have zoomed in closer leaving just the 
   more detailed map visible. However, if the order of display is such 
   that the 1:50,000 map is &quot;on top&quot; of the 1:10,000 map, the 
   latter will be hidden &quot;behind&quot; the former until it reaches 
   its cut-out scale. Consequently you would not see the 1:10,000 map 
   until you had zoomed right in. To fix the problem, move the 1:10,000 
   map down of the list of map layers until it is below the 1:50,000 map.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: In <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>,
    map layers are displayed &quot;on top&quot; of layers further up the 
   list. However, the &quot;Base Map Sheet&quot; <IMG SRC="..\BaseMapIcon.gif" WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   is a special case and will always be appear &quot;on top&quot; of all 
   other layers.</P>
  <H3>
   To change the order of display of map layers:</H3>
  <P>
   Use the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Map Layers</SPAN> box in 
   the bottom left-hand corner of the open Map window. To open the map 
   you want to work on select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Map - 
   View Map</SPAN> from the Main menu then, in the sub-menu, select the 
   required map, or use the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Display 
   Map Window</SPAN> icon <IMG SRC="..\BaseMapIcon.gif" WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   on the toolbar. If the map window is already open, use the Active Map 
   box (top left) to select the required map.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click on a layer's name in the Map Layers list at the bottom left of 
    the window to select it.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Drag it to a new position in the list, or use the 
    up <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\Up.gif" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="22" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    or down <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\Down.gif" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="22" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    arrows at the top of the list to move it up or down.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Or, select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Map - Map Options</SPAN> 
   from the main menu, then select the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Map
    Layers</SPAN> tab. Select the map you want to work on using the drop 
   down arrow beside the Map box. Note that this box is only displayed 
   if you have more than one map loaded.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click the layer you want to move to select it.<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Click the &quot;Move Up&quot; or &quot;Move 
    Down&quot; buttons. The selected layer will move up or down one 
    position in the list for each click.</P>
