  <P>
   Information supplied with <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>,
    mainly as part of the dictionaries or term-lists, is marked as 
   'System-supplied'. Updates (e.g. of dictionaries) supplied via the <A HREF="..\Glossary\NBN.htm">NBN</A> 
   web site will be similarly marked (see the <A HREF="http://www.nbn.org.uk/">NBN
    website</A>).</P>
  <P>
   Users are not allowed to edit information which is marked as system-supplied.</P>
  <P>
   When users make additions to term-lists or add new taxa or biotopes, 
   these entries are distinguished from the centrally supplied and 
   supported entries because they are not marked as system-supplied.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE:</SPAN> New taxa and biotopes 
   that are added by the user, and are therefore not marked as 
   system-supplied, are not exported (which means none of the data 
   associated with them, such as observations, are exported).</P>
  <P>
   To export such data:</P>

   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Get the taxon or biotope added to the centrally supported dictionary <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">via</SPAN>

    <P>
     Use the <A HREF="Merge_Data_Items.htm">Merge data</A> tool to 
     transfer all items which rely on your addition to the centrally 
     supported equivalent. At the end of this process, your addition will 
     be deleted.</P>
