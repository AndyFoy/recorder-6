   The Taxon details Group page of the Edit Taxon Details window allows 
   the user to create a names, arbitrary group of other taxa which can 
   then be used to produce a report or to map all the taxa included 
   within the group.</P>
  <P>
   In this example, a group &quot;Larger Brachycera&quot; is being 
   created. This is a collection of 11 families of flies for which there 
   is a National Recording Scheme.</P>

   To set up a group:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Create a new taxon to contain the group and provide a name for it. 
    Press [Add] on the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Taxon Dictionary Details</SPAN> 
    window and fill in the Name and Rank in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">General</SPAN> page.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Go to the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Taxon Group</SPAN> page.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Drag the taxa you want to include in the group into the list. These 
    can be at any level in the taxonomic hierarchy (in this example they 
    are families).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you have already set up a rucksack containing the taxa you want to 
    include, click the [Use Rucksack] button. You will see a menu listing 
    all the rucksacks the system knows about (consequently, the rucksack 
    you want to use does not have to be open). Choose the one you want 
    and the items from its Taxon List will be added to the list in this 
    page. If the list is not quite as you want it, drag in additional 
    names or delete unwanted items using the &lt;Del&gt; key.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Once the list is correct, press [Save] and the taxa you have chosen 
    will be expanded so that the list includes all the taxa underneath 
    them in the taxonomic hierarchy and the <A HREF="Taxon_Group_Index.htm">Taxon
     Group Index</A> will be updated appropriately. This make take some time.</P>
