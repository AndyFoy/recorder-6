   Negative records</H1>
  <P>
   It can be extremely valuable to record the fact that a particular 
   taxon was sought and NOT found. However, 'negative records' usually 
   have to be treated with a great deal of caution. It is pertinent to ask:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    were the recorders who made the search experienced in finding the 
    particular taxon or biotope?</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    did they look in the right place?</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    were the correct search methods used?</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    were the conditions, time of year, time of day, etc. correct?</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    how often, for how long, and how persistently was the search carried 
    out (especially relevant if the object of the search is cryptic, 
    secretive or otherwise hard to find)?</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   It is therefore particularly important to include as much detailed 
   information as possible when making a negative record, so that users 
   of the record can assess how much confidence they can have in it.</P>
  <P>
   Negative records from monitoring programmes tend to be far less 
   controversial. If the same sampling method is applied at regular 
   intervals at the same location, or at a series of locations, to 
   record particular taxa, then zero results in some of the samples can 
   usually be analysed with confidence. This may be as important to an 
   analysis as positive results.</P>
  <P>
   Negative records can be made by entering a measurement with a 
   measurement type of 'Abundance' datum value of zero in a taxon occurrence.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">TIP:</SPAN> Negative records will 
   not appear in distribution maps and reports unless you specifically 
   indicate that they should be included (see Report Wizard &#150;
