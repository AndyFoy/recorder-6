   Surveys</H1>
  <P>
   In <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder,</SPAN> all 
   observations <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">must</SPAN> be related 
   to a survey. The survey provides information about the organisation 
   or individual that organised the work, the time period over which it 
   was done, the geographic area that it covered, and its status 
   (on-going, completed, etc.). If the survey resulted in publications, 
   or you have other material about it stored on your computer, then 
   'Sources' can provide links to this information.</P>
  <P>
   If you wish to contribute information to the National Biodiversity 
   Network (<A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/NBN.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">NBN</A>),
    it will be necessary to supply '<A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/Meta-data.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">meta-data</A>'
    . The survey entry provides this type of data.</P>
  <P>
   In the <A HREF="..\Glossary\NBN.htm">NBN</A> data model, all 
   observations form part of a survey. When data are collected for a 
   particular recording scheme, or as part of a habitat survey or 
   monitoring programme, the survey to which it belongs will usually be 
   obvious. The survey entry for professionally run schemes should 
   ideally be prepared by the organisers of the survey, and distributed 
   to participants in <A HREF="NBN_Transfer_Format.htm">NBN transfer 
   format </A>for import into their copy. However, for old data, those 
   managing the data will need to decide how best to organise it into 
   surveys and prepare suitable entries. Many individuals will probably 
   regard their own personal records, not made as part of any organised 
   scheme, as a single, ongoing survey called '<I>x</I>&#146;s personal records'.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: surveys in the 
   observation hierarchy can be organised into folders by assigning one 
   or more <A HREF="Surveys_Tags_Tab.htm">Tags</A> to them. This 
   facility becomes available when <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Organise
    Surveys by Tag</SPAN> is ticked on the General tab in <A HREF="Options_General.htm">Tools
    - Options</A>. The folders appear as the top level in the hierarchy 
   and the folder names are the tags. The <A HREF="Surveys_Tags_Tab.htm">Tags</A> 
   can be created and assigned to surveys in the observation hierarchy. 
   They can also be created via <A HREF="Enhanced_Term_Lists.htm">Tools 
   - Enhanced Termlists</A>. Tags enable groups of surveys to be 
   exported and included in reports more easily.</P>
