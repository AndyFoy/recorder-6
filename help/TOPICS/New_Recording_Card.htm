       <P>
        When you create a new recording card, it must have a list of species 
        to display on the card. This species list can come from a taxon 
        dictionary list (see <A HREF="Dictionaries_Overview.htm">Dictionaries overview</A>)
         or a list of taxa in a <A HREF="Rucksack.htm">Rucksack</A>. The 
        options are:</P>
       <UL TYPE="circle">
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
        <P>
         Taxon Dictionary. Choosing this option enables the user to select a 
         checklist from the drop-down box. This checklist will form the 
         species list for the recording card.</P>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
        <P>
         Rucksack. Choosing this option enables the user to select a rucksack 
         from the drop-down box. The list of species in the selected rucksack 
         will form the species list in the recording card.</P>
        </UL>
       <P CLASS="note">
        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tip</SPAN>: If an item in the Taxon 
        list in the Rucksack has further items nested beneath it, you are 
        prompted whether or not to expand the list in the Recording Card to 
        include these items. So, for example, you could put 'Carabidae' in 
        the Rucksack list and accept the option to expand the list, resulting 
        in a list of all ground beetle species in the Recording Card. This is 
        a great deal quicker than building a list containing all the 
        individual species names!</TD>

      <TD WIDTH="74%" VALIGN=TOP>
       <P>
        At it's most basic, a recording card will consist of just two 
        columns; a list of species names and a column of tick boxes. You may, 
        at this point choose any additional columns that you want to include 
        to allow you to record additional information. The additional columns 
        are of two types;</P>
       <UL>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
        <P>
         standard - a fixed list of 11 columns</P>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
        <P>
         measurements - includes all available combinations of measurement 
         type and qualifier.</P>
        </UL>
       <P>
        These two types are displayed on two tabs, which can be switched between.</P>
       <P>
        See <A HREF="Recording_Card_Columns.htm">Recording card columns</A> 
        for details of columns available</P>
       <UL>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">

       <H3>
        Order of columns</H3>
       <P>
        The order in which the columns are displayed on the recording card 
        will follow the order in which they are listed in the right hand list 
        box. For example, if Count is displayed at the top of the list box, 
        then it will be the leftmost column in the recording card after the 
        taxon name. To change the order in which the columns are displayed:</P>
       <UL>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
        <P>
         Select the item in the right hand list box whose display position you 
         want to change.</P>
        <UL>
         <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
         <P>

        Names of columns</H3>
       <P>
        The default titles of some of the columns, especially some of the 
        measurement columns are very long and cumbersome. You may wish to 
        change the titles to something more useful.</P>
       <UL>
        <LI CLASS="mvd-P">

  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">TIP:</SPAN> Recording cards are 
   saved as .crd files in the \Recorder 200x\Recording Card directory in 
   a standard installation. It will probably be located on the server in 
   a networked installation. This directory is specified in the Options 
   - <A HREF="Options_File_Locations.htm">File Locations dialog box</A>. 
   Because the cards are saved as normal text files, they can be 
   exchanged between users. See <A HREF="Sharing_Record_Cards_with_Others.htm">Sharing
    Recording Cards with others</A>.</P>

   Troubleshooting</H3>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE:</SPAN> If you base a 
   Recording card on a species list from a Rucksack, then when you save 
   the Recording card, the list of species is read from the Rucksack and 
   saved as part of the Recording card file. However, if you 
   subsequently change the species list in the Rucksack, the changes 
   WILL NOT appear when you use the Recording card.</P>
  <P>
   If you want the changes to the list in the Rucksack to be reflected 
   in the Recording card, do the following:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Open the 'New Recording Card' window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select the card in question from the list in the 'Name' prompt.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Choose the [OK] button.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You will see a message reporting that a Recording card of this name 
    already exists and asking you to confirm that you want to over-write it.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Choose the [Yes] button, and the Recording card file will be updated 
    with the modified species list from the Rucksack.</P>
