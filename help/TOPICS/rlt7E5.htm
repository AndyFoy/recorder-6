   Upgrading <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN></H1>
  <P>
   Upgrades for <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>will 
   periodically become available and will need to be installed in your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">system</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;"> </SPAN>so
    that you can take advantage of the bug fixes and the new/improved 
   features they contain. When an upgrade to <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   becomes available <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/JNCC.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">JNCC</A> 
   will announce it on the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   Forum, part of the <A HREF="http://forums.nbn.org.uk/index.php">NBN Forum</A>,
    which can also be accessed from the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.
    You are advised to check this from time to time for news of upgrades 
   and other information about <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   Upgrades to <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> are 
   made available as &quot;.zip&quot; files that you download from the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.
    They are &quot;zipped&quot; or compressed so that they will download 
   more quickly.</P>
  <P>
   For the details of the changes in an upgrade, see the accompanying <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">release
    notes</SPAN>, which can be accessed from the same place on the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    </SPAN>web site as the upgrade itself. <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Please</SPAN> 
   read them to check for any variations in the standard instructions 
   below for running a particular upgrade. Provided this Help is updated 
   for an upgrade, the <A HREF="Overview.htm">Home page</A> will list 
   the new features and changes to functionality in it.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note:</SPAN> Prior to version 6.9 
   of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>, upgrades to 
   the software and the dictionaries were combined but in version 6.9 a <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Dictionary
    Upgrade Kit </SPAN>was introduced so that changes to the taxon 
   dictionary could be done independent of changes to the software. See <A HREF="Dictionary_Upgrades.htm">Dictionary
    Updates</A> for details.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">:
    Sometimes upgrades are cumulative, i.e. running one upgrade will 
   apply more than one so it is not necessary to run each upgrade 
   separately. Whether or not an upgrade is cumulative will be made 
   clear on the web site so please check for this information before 
   upgrading your system.</SPAN></P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: Whenever an upgrade is 
   to be installed, it should be done through an <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">administrator
    user account</SPAN> to avoid any potential problems due to limited 
   user account access rights. The &quot;sa&quot; login or a trusted 
   connection (see below) with database owner privileges over the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   database is required during the upgrade.<BR>
   <BR>
   If you are upgrading a standalone copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   on your personal computer running Windows XP, the way you normally 
   login will probably provide sufficient rights to run an upgrade, but 
   if you are operating on a network this may not be the case and you 
   may need to ask a system administrator to run the upgrade for you. If 
   you are running Vista, you will need to right click <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">RecorderUpgrade.exe</SPAN> 
   and select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Run as administrator</SPAN>,
    to give yourself the necessary rights. If you are running Windows 7, 
   you will need to double click <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">RecorderUpgrade.exe</SPAN> 
   then answer Yes to the User Account Control question 'Do you want to 
   allow the following program (RecorderUpgrade.exe) from an unknown 
   publisher to make changes to this computer?</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   To check the version of your copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   to ensure you run the correct upgrade, use <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Help
    - About Recorder 6 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">from 
   the main menu.</SPAN></P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">The upgrade process replaces 
   various files and may change your database. This will not, however, 
   affect any information you have entered. It may take a few minutes 
   but you will see progress bars and messages as the various tasks take 
   place. When an upgrade completes, it </SPAN>stores <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">a
    sequence code for the upgrade being run </SPAN>in the <A HREF="Accessing_the_Database_from_Other_Software.htm"><SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> database</A>.
    This can be found in the Setting table, in the DATA field where NAME 
   = &quot;DB Seq&quot;. If you have SQL Server tools or Microsoft <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Access</SPAN>,
    you will be able to check the value in this field. It is used to <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">prevent
    you from skipping upgrades or running them out of sequence</SPAN>.</P>
  <P>
   Users are advised to backup their database prior to upgrading via <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><A HREF="Backups.htm">Tools
    - Database Tools - Backup Database</A></SPAN> or the SQL Server 
   tools they use for backups.</P>

   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">Download the required upgrade from </SPAN>the
     <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4612">Download Latest Version</A> 
    section of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> web 
    site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>,
     and save it somewhere on your hard disk. It is recommended that you 
    store this in a folder outside your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     6</SPAN> folder(s).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Unzip the file you downloaded. Clicking on the &quot;.zip&quot; file 
    will usually open the extraction software on your computer. You need 
    to select the options that will unzip the selected file to a new 
    folder in the same location and retain the folder structure when the 
    file is unzipped. If extraction software is not available, you will 
    need a suitable software tool, such as <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</A>,
     to extract the files from the &quot;.zip&quot; file.</P>

      </SPAN>It is important that the folder structure is retained when 
     the file is unzipped but this may not happen automatically unless you 
     have the appropriate options selected. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">If
      there is a Scripts folder in </SPAN>the file you downloaded<SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">,
      there must also be one in the unzipped folder. Any scripts in the 
     upgrade will not be run unless they are in that folder.</SPAN></P>
