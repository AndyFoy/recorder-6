   Drag and Drop</H1>
  <P>
   When you need to add or edit a reference to an item elsewhere in the 
   system, you can usually do so by dragging the required information 
   and dropping it into the control. For example, you could drag a 
   location name from the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Location</SPAN> 
   window into the location prompt of a record card.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Use your mouse to select the information you want to use.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Drag it to the place where you want to use it by holding down the 
    primary mouse button while you move the mouse. The cursor will change 
    to <IMG SRC="..\CursorImages\DragCursor.gif" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="31" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">,
     indicating that you are dragging something</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When the cursor is over the place where you want to use the 
    information, release the mouse button to 'drop' the item.</P>
   </UL>
  <H3>
   Troubleshooting</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you are over a place where you cannot drop the item, the cursor 
    changes to <IMG SRC="..\CursorImages\CannotDropCursor.gif" WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="18" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">.
     This could be because:</P>
   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     The information you are dragging is not appropriate at that point 
     (for example, you cannot drag a species name into a prompt for a location).</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     The window into which you are trying to drag the information is not 
     in Edit mode.</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     You do not have the necessary access rights to add or change the data 
     at the place to which you are trying to drag the item.</P>
    </UL>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Coloured borders can be used to indicate controls that can be the 
   source and destination of items to drag and drop. See <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Options
    - </SPAN><A HREF="Options_Appearance.htm">Appearance</A></P>
