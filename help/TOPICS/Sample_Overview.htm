   Sample</H1>
  <P>
   A sample record describes a particular sample which was made during 
   the survey event to which it is attached. Several different samples 
   may be made during one survey event. This might involve employing the 
   same sampling method at several places (e.g. throwing several 
   quadrats), or could involve using several different methods at the 
   same place (e.g. making observations along a transect, recording 
   species coverage in a quadrat and setting a pitfall trap). Each 
   distinct method employed by a particular person at a distinct place 
   should be treated as a separate sample.</P>
  <P>
   Samples result in observations of species (taxon occurrences) and/or 
   habitats (biotope occurrence). Typically many species observations 
   may result, but only one habitat observation.</P>
  <P>
   The information contained in a sample record includes the sampling 
   method, who made the sample, where it was made and the time. The 
   location and date default to those given for the survey event to 
   which the sample is attached, but it is often possible (and 
   desirable) to be more precise. For example, the locality given for a 
   survey event may be the nature reserve that was visited, but 
   individual samples can be localised to particular management 
   compartments (perhaps set up as sub-sites in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Locations</SPAN> 
   window) or precise grid references. Similarly, the time element can 
   be more precise and might include the start time and duration of the sample.</P>
  <P>
   A variety of measurements might also be made at a sampling point, for 
   example the vegetation height might be measured in a quadrat, or the 
   conductivity of the water at the point where aquatic invertebrates 
   were netted. The <A HREF="Measurements.htm">Measurements</A> page 
   allows these to be recorded.</P>
  <P>
   In the case of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">ad hoc</SPAN> 
   observations, there will probably be very little information recorded 
   in the sample. The locality, date and recorder will default to those 
   for the survey event, and only the sampling method need be given 
   (probably 'field observation').</P>
