        <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Export Data</SPAN> - the function 
        of this option is to export the observations listed in a form 
        suitable for importing into another copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN>.
         Note that in this case it is not just the data on view in the filter 
        result that is exported, but all data associated with these 
        observations. An export type needs to be selected and the types on 
        offer will be the same as when doing other exports - see <A HREF="Export.htm">Exports</A>.
         If the appropriate <A HREF="Install_Addin.htm">add-in</A> has been 
        installed, exports to other systems will also be possible, e.g. to <A HREF="DMAP_Export.htm">DMAP</A>

        Gateway. When data is exported this way the Report Wizard is being 
        used to select the observations for export; what is exported will be 
        dependent on the export type not on the attributes selected when 
        going through the wizard.</P>

   At this point you can use the [Back] button to go back through the 
   screens of the Wizard and modify your selections. If you choose 
   [Finish], the Wizard will terminate. <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">Once
    you do this, you cannot go back and edit that report. You can also 
   change the order of the columns by dragging and dropping the cell 
   that contains the column heading. This order is remembered if the 
   report is saved.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   You can <A HREF="Saving_a_query.htm">save</A> a complete report 
   (including the criteria from the Report Wizard and a report layout 
   from the Report Designer). Once saved, it can be run again at any 
   time (from <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Reports - Run</SPAN> on 
   the main menu). When you run a previously saved report like this, the 
   result reflects the current state of the database.</P>
  <P>
   The green filter bar at the top allows you to filter the observations 
   in the filter result. To apply a filter:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Type some filter text in the green box at the top of the appropriate 
    column and press &lt;Enter&gt;. For example, if you typed 
    &quot;bell&quot; &lt;Enter&gt; in the green box underneath Taxon 
    Common Name, the system would return just the observations where the 
    data in that column <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">started with</SPAN> 
    &quot;bell&quot;. If you typed &quot;%bell&quot; &lt;Enter&gt; the 
    system would return the observations where the data in that column <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">contained</SPAN> &quot;bell&quot;.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   To remove a filter:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Delete the text in the green box at the top of the appropriate column 
    and press &lt;Enter&gt;.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Another facility available from the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Filter
    Results</SPAN> window is the ability to examine (and edit) the 
   individual items shown in the grid. To do this:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Double-click in a cell in the grid.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   OR</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select a cell by clicking in it with your mouse or moving the 
    highlight bar around using the arrow keys.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Then click the <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\Report16.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    button in the active toolbar.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   The observation window will open, filtered to display the selected 
   survey event, sample or observation. Use the [Show All] button 
   (bottom right) to remove the filter. All data in the window will then 
   be accessible again via the hierarchy, or list, in the left-hand 
   panel, and the item that was selected when the [Show All] button was 
   clicked will be highlighted.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: if you select a cell 
   from a taxon occurrence (species observation), e.g. a <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Taxon
    Latin Name</SPAN>, then the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Observations</SPAN> 
   hierarchy opens with a filter on it so that the taxon occurrence is 
   on view with its parent entries but not any other observation data. </P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: if you select a cell 
   from a sample, e.g. a <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Sample Date</SPAN>,
    then the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Observations</SPAN> 
   hierarchy opens with a filter on it so that the sample is on view 
   along with its parent entries and all the taxon occurrences in it but 
   not any other observation data. </P>
  <P>
   Once an observation is displayed in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Observations</SPAN> 
   hierarchy, it can be edited as normal. A good way of locating and 
   correcting errors is therefore to use the Wizard to generate a report 
   that will find the incorrect data (e.g. use a <A HREF="Bounding_Boxes.htm">bounding
    box</A> to find observations with <A HREF="Spatial_References_Overview.htm">spatial
    references</A> that are in the wrong area, or set an Additional 
   Filter to select dates that are outside the expected range). Then 
   access and edit the erroneous items from the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Filter
    Result</SPAN> window.</P>
