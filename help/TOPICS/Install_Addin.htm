   Installing Add-Ins</H1>
  <P>
   For details of the add-ins that can be installed in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder,</SPAN> 
   see the Recorder web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.</P>
  <P>
   This facility is accessed by selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools

   The list shows modules that are already installed. If a module is 
   selected in the list, its description (Read-only) will appear in the 
   'Description' box.</P>
  <H3>
   To install an Add-In:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click [Install].</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    This will open a standard <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Windows 
    file </SPAN>location dialog.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Locate the Add-In module&#146;s file which will have a .ocx or .dll extension.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Choose [Open] to install the selected file and close the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">file</SPAN> dialog.</P>

   <P>
    The module will be installed.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If this module has previously been installed on this copy (an earlier 
    version, for example) - even if it has been removed - you will see 
    the following message. Click [Yes] and installation will proceed normally.</P>

    An add-in may be supplied with several files, apart from the .dll or 
    .ocx itself. These typically include one or more files with 
    &quot;.bmp&quot; extensions and sometimes an &quot;.mdb&quot; file 
    and perhaps others. All these files MUST be in the same directory as 
    the .dll or .ocx file when you do the installation. If the files that 
    the add-in requires cannot be found, the installation will fail.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P-warning">
   <P CLASS="warning">
    You cannot install an add-in from the \Recorder\Addins directory. You 
    must install the add-in and its related files from a floppy-disk, CD 
    or some other location on your computer's hard disk. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">Recorder
     </SPAN>will copy the files to the Addins directory as part of the 
    installation process. If you attempt to install an add-in from the 
    same directory that <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">Recorder
     </SPAN>is trying to copy it to, you will see the message:</P>

    </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    The error occurs, in this case, because <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     </SPAN>itself is the 'other process' that is already using the file. 
    What you have asked it to do is to simultaneously read and write the 
    same file!</P>

   To remove an Add-In module:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Highlight the module you wish to remove in the list.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click [Remove].</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You will be asked to confirm that you really want to remove this module.</P>
   </UL>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE: </SPAN>If the Add-In module 
   is implemented as a DLL, you will be unable to remove it and then 
   install it again within the same session (if you attempt this, you 
   will see the &quot;Error 32:&quot; message above). You must close the 
   application and restart before the add-in can be re-installed. This 
   is a limitation imposed by <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : normal;">Windows</SPAN>,
    because DLLs are not removed from memory until the programme that 
   loaded them terminates.</P>
