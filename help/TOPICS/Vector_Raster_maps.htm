   Map file formats, vectors and rasters</H1>
  <P>
   A <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">vector</SPAN> map consists of 
   lines defined by a series of co-ordinates. This is how digitised site 
   boundaries are stored. Their advantages are that they can be stored 
   in a fairly compact format and can be drawn at a wide range of scales 
   without distortion or loss of detail. However, digitising a map is 
   quite a long and labour intensive process. The co-ordinates of each 
   twist and turn in the line that is being digitised have to be read 
   off and recorded electronically. Consequently, vector datasets tend 
   to be expensive and each set of data usually covers only one type of 
   feature (e.g. the boundary of a site).</P>
  <P>
   A <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">raster tile</SPAN> is a picture 
   consisting of rows and columns of coloured pixels. They are made by 
   scanning a paper-map, a satellite image or an aerial photograph. 
   Large images (such as a map sheet covering a sizeable area) are 
   broken down into a set of '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">tiles</SPAN>'
    &#150; rectangular pieces of manageable size &#150; which can be 
   shown side by side on screen to form the complete picture. Given the <A HREF="Bounding_Boxes.htm">spatial
    co-ordinates</A> of the corners of a tile, the co-ordinate of any 
   given pixel can be accurately determined. The advantage of raster 
   maps is that they can contain a lot of information &#150; they can 
   allow a conventional published map or an aerial photograph to be 
   placed on screen. The main disadvantage is that a raster map can only 
   be displayed at a limited range of scales around that at which it was 
   scanned. If you try to display a it at a much smaller scale, then 
   detail is rapidly lost and if you zoom in to a much larger scale then 
   the screen image breaks down into a series of square blocks 
   representing the individual pixels of the original scanned image.</P>
  <P>
   With the ready availability of cheap, desk-top scanners it is easy to 
   scan a paper-map or an aerial photograph. However, the process of 
   making it into useable raster tiles is quite involved and has to be 
   done very carefully if you are going to rely on the result to derive 
   accurate spatial references:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When aerial photographs are taken, it is rare for the camera to be 
    pointing absolutely vertically downwards, and this introduces 
    distortions due to perspective. Also, the ground is not flat, and 
    features on slopes will appear closer together or further apart 
    depending on whether the slope faces towards or away from the camera. 
    These distortions have to be corrected in the final image.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The rows and columns of pixels in the scanned image must be 
    accurately aligned to the spatial co-ordinate system. Any rotation, 
    or distortion due to variation in the scanning speed across the 
    image, will lead to inaccuracies in the spatial co-ordinates derived 
    from the map tile.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The edges of tiles have to be matched up accurately so that tiles fit 
    together properly and features like roads and rivers run from one 
    tile to the next without breaks at the tile boundaries.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Ideally, the whole process should be carried out so that the colours 
    of features are consistent across the whole set of tiles. Then 
    similar features can be recognised in different places on the 
    resulting map irrespective of the tile on which they appear.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   To do these jobs well requires high quality scanning equipment which 
   can handle large originals (e.g. whole map sheets), and sophisticated 
   software that can correct for distortions in the image and align it 
   to the spatial co-ordinate system (ortho-rectification). There are 
   many commercial agencies that offer these services.</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   The copyright conditions on published maps usually do not allow their 
   scanning and storage in electronic form. This is the case, for 
   example, for Ordnance Survey maps.</P>
