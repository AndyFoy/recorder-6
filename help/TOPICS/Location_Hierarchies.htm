  <P>
   A location in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>uses 
   the concept of sites and sub-sites. A site is the main location 
   entity, and can be divided into any number of smaller entities or 
   sub-sites. These sub-sites can form a hierarchy with any number of 
   levels, and can be fairly complex. Information can be associated with 
   sites and sub-sites in exactly the same way &#150; using the detail 
   panel on the right hand side of the location explorer.</P>
  <P>
   The position of particular sites in the hierarchy can be changed by 
   using either <A HREF="Drag_and_Drop.htm">drag and drop</A> or <A HREF="..\Report Designer\Cut_and_paste.htm">cut
    and paste</A> in the Location tree view. To move a location in this way;</P>

    on your copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The details of the location to be moved must not conflict with those 
    of its new parent, i.e. if the new parent has been associated with 
    specific grid squares, the child must be within those grid squares.</P>

  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: multiple locations can 
   be selected for moving to a new position using &lt;Shift&gt; + left 
   click of the mouse button or &lt;Ctrl&gt; + left click, as in Windows 
   Explorer. They can then be dragged to the new position or moved to it 
   by right clicking and selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Promote
