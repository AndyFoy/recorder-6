   Features overview</H1>
  <P>
   Features are significant aspects of locations which are managed or 
   monitored. They could, for example, be the reasons for which a 
   designated site was notified, or the items for which specific 
   provisions are made in a management plan. Features are most likely to 
   be used by organisations responsible for the management of sites.</P>
  <P>
   In<SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"> Recorder</SPAN>, features are 
   linked to a location, which can be at any level of the location 
   hierarchy. A given location can have any number of features 
   associated with it.</P>
  <P>
   Apart from their general description, features can have management 
   aims and threats. It is also possible to record occurrences of damage 
   to the feature.</P>
