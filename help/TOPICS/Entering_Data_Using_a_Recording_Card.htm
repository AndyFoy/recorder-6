   added to the list.</SPAN></P>

   Modifying data in samples</H3>
  <P>
   The data in a sample can be loaded into a recording card for editing. 
   In some cases this will be easier than making the changes in the 
   observation hierarchy itself.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">To load data into a recording card:</SPAN></P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select a sample in the observation hierarchy and right click.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Load into Record Card</SPAN> 
    from the menu that appears.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    In the sub-menu, select the recording card that you want to use. If 
    there are no cards listed, you will need to create a recording card 
    (see <A HREF="New_Recording_Card.htm">creating a new Recording Card</A>).</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Recording Card</SPAN> dialog 
   box appears with the name of the recording card and sample in the 
   title bar. As much of the data from the sample as the recording card 
   can accommodate will be displayed and the taxa from the taxon 
   occurrences will be ticked in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Species
    list grid. </SPAN>Taxa not on the recording card but for which there 
   are observations in the sample will be added and ticked. If some of 
   the data can't be displayed, because the recording card doesn't have 
   a box or column for it, a warning will appear. Data that can't be 
   modified will be displayed with a pale blue background. The species 
   name displayed will be taken from the preferred determination. Data 
   from other determinations won't be on view and hence can't be edited 
   via this mechanism.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">When sample data is loaded into a 
   recording card, you can:</SPAN></P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Edit the date, location, location name and spatial reference. Where 
    appropriate, you will be offered the option to cascade the changes as 
    specified in <A HREF="Validating_data.htm">editing dates and location data</A>.
     The other sample data will be read-only.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Add taxon occurrences by ticking additional species, or using the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add
     Species</SPAN> box.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Edit the data displayed for taxon occurrences. Note that the name 
    can't be edited. If a name is incorrect untick the observation to 
    delete it and add another one.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Delete taxon occurrences by unticking the species.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Once you have completed your changes, you can save them by clicking 
   on [Save].</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
