   If you need to export the same group of records on a regular basis, 
   the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Export Management</SPAN> 
   facility allows you to automate much of the process. Export 
   Management is accessible through Tools on the main menu.</P>
  <P>
   There are two elements involved in export management;</P>
  <H3>
   Export filters</H3>
  <P>
   The <A HREF="Export_filters.htm">export filter</A> is a definition of 
   the records that should be included in the export. E.g. All otter 
   records in Wales.</P>
  <UL>
   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Export filters can be saved and then used on their own as the basis 
     of an export at a later time.</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Export filters can created and then sent from one person to another. 
     This means that someone can work out what data they need, and simply 
     send the filter to the data supplier. It is then a simple process for 
     the data provider to make the appropriate export and send it out 
     based on the request.</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Export filters can also be used as the basis for a Recording Scheme.</P>

   Recording Schemes</H3>
  <P>
   Quite often, an export of records needs to be sent to the same person 
   on a regular basis. E.g. All bird records sent to the county bird 
   recorder once a month. A <A HREF="submit_to_a_scheme.htm">Recording Scheme</A> 
   defines the <A HREF="Export_filters.htm">export filter</A>, the data 
   format to be used and the e-mail address that the records should be 
   sent to. The monthly submission can then be made at the touch of a 
   button. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> finds 
   observations in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : normal;">Export filter</SPAN> 
   which have been entered or changed since your last submission. It 
   exports only them, zips the resulting file and e-mails it to the 
   designated E-mail address. The time and date is automatically 
   recorded, so that only new information is sent next time.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   Note: Alternatively, an export filter is not defined and all records 
   are included in the recording scheme.</P>
