   XML reports supplied with <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN></H1>
  <P>
   Version 6.15 of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   comes with numerous XML reports. Selecting <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Reports
    - Run</SPAN> from the main menu displays a hierarchy of the reports 
   that can be run using that facility - for full details <FONT COLOR="BLACK">see
    <A HREF="Running_Reports.htm">Running Reports</A>. The top level of 
   the hierarchy lists the different categories of reports. Clicking </FONT>the
    <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\TreePlus.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="9" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> button<FONT COLOR="BLACK"> 
   beside a category displays the sub-categories or the XML reports 
   themselves. Below is a list of the main categories followed by other 
   information and a list of the XML reports in version 6.15. Note that 
   a category will only appear if reports belonging to it are present.</FONT></P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Redundant reports</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   This category is included simply to allow the deprecation of reports 
   that are no longer required. Rather than deleting them from your 
   system, upgrades usually re-categorise them into this folder and you 
   can decide yourself whether to formally delete them from your system. 
   Note that if all redundant reports are deleted this folder will no 
   longer appear.</P>

  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Bounding Box Reports</SPAN> - these 
    use a bounding box defined by the spatial reference of the SW and NE 
    corner. Note that these reports convert the SW and NE spatial 
    references to Lat/Long and use the Lat/Long of the records to select 
    the data. The effect of this is that records close to the boundaries 
    can be included or excluded from the report when they might not be if 
    the selection were based on grid references. Grid Square reports 
    produce more accurate results, but only include squares which are 
    totally within the bounding box.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">

  <H1>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-size : 12.0pt;">Report names</SPAN></H1>
  <P>
   Each system supplied report is a separate XML file, with an extension 
   of .xml, stored in the \User Files\Reports folder within your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN> folder unless the location has been changed using <A HREF="Options_File_Locations.htm">Tools
    - Options - File Locations</A>. In a standard standalone 
   installation with Windows XP they will be in C:\Program 
   Files\Recorder 6\User Files\Reports. The file names of the JNCC 
   supplied ones start with JNCC followed by a unique reference which 
   can be used to refer to the report, e.g. Ln5. This is made up of an 
   abbreviation of the report type followed by a number. The name of the 
   report, as it appears in the Reports - Run hierarchy, is stored in 
   the file and is usually the file name without the &quot;JNCC&quot; 
   providing a link from the report name to the file. Some of the system 
   supplied reports were provided by Sussex Biological Record Centre.</P>
  <H1>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-size : 12.0pt;">Report parameters</SPAN></H1>
  <P>
   Many reports have parameters which allow you to specify what you want 
   included in the report. Amongst these are often a set of filters 
   which correspond to the <A HREF="Additional_Filters_Contraints.htm">constraints</A> 
   that can be set via the <A HREF="Additional_Filters_Overview.htm">[Additional
    Filters]</A> button on the <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Layout_Selection.htm">Layout
    Selection</A> page in the <A HREF="Using_the_report_wizard.htm">Report
    Wizard</A>. These offer the ability to include or exclude:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Confidential Data<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Unchecked Data<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Failed/Pending Verification Data<BR>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Zero Abundance Data</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   In addition, reports which select observations based on spatial 
   references or bounding boxes often have the ability to include or 
   exclude observations with a Spatial Reference Qualifier of 'Site 
   Centroid'. Although not labelled as such this is displayed beside 
   spatial references in the observation hierarchy and elsewhere.</P>
  <H1>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-size : 12.0pt;">Report output</SPAN></H1>
  <P>
   When an XML report is run the results are displayed in the <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Filter_Result.htm">filter
    result</A>, in the same spreadsheet format as the results from the 
   report wizard. From the filter result you can choose what to do with 
   the selected data by clicking on the [Report output] button and 
   selecting one the options that appear, e.g. <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Copy
    All</SPAN> to copy all the data to the Windows clipboard so that it 
   can be pasted into a file such as an excel spreadsheet or word 
   document, <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Send to Map</SPAN> to do 
   a distribution map of the data<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">, 
   Export to Excel</SPAN> to save the data in a new excel file, etc. Any 
   options that aren't available for the type of report you have done 
   will be greyed out.</P>
  <P>
   When<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"> New Report Template</SPAN> is 
   selected the report designer opens so that you can design a report 
   layout which will enable you to print the data in a format suitable 
   for giving to customers - see <A HREF="..\Report Designer\Designing_a_report_2.htm">Report
    designer</A> for details. Note that at present the Report Designer 
   isn't always reliable.</P>
  <H1>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-size : 12.0pt;">Modifying reports</SPAN></H1>
  <P>
   The system supplied reports will produce useful results but can also 
   be adapted to meet your own needs. Alternatively, the techniques they 
   include can be used to produce new reports.</P>
  <P>
   You should not change the actual system supplied reports, but take a 
   copy of the file and rename it for your own use. If you don't do this 
   then, for example, if an upgrade contains an updated version of it, 
   this may overwrite your changed version. It is suggested that you 
   replace the JNCC in the file name with your Site ID to make a unique 
   file name, e.g. JNCC_Sq2_GridSquare.xml would become 
   SR000027_Sq2a_GridSquare.xml. See Report names above for the location 
   of the files.</P>
  <P>
   The XML reports are text files that can be opened by a number of 
   programs but they will be easiest to edit in Notepad. Right click on 
   the file and select &quot;Open With&quot; then &quot;Notepad&quot;, 
   if that option is available. If not, select &quot;Choose Program&quot;
    then select &quot;Notepad&quot;.</P>
  <P>
   To differentiate your report from the original, you should edit the 
   menu path, title and description in the &lt;CustomReport tag near the 
   start of the file as this is the information that appears in the 
   report hierarchy in <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   to enable you to locate and run it. You should also edit the comment 
   at the top, i.e. the information between &lt;!-- and --&gt; as 
   recommended in the note in <A HREF="XML_reports.htm">XML reports</A>.</P>
  <P>
   For example: Change:</P>
  <P>
   &lt;CustomReport menupath=&quot;Geographic Area/Location Reports\Grid 
   Square Reports&quot;<BR>
   title=&quot;Sq2_Summary by Square(s)&quot; description=&quot;Displays 
   records for specified Grid Square ...&quot; &gt; to:</P>
  <P>
   &lt;CustomReport menupath=&quot;SR000027 Reports&quot;<BR>
   title=&quot;Sq2a_Summary by Square(s) for SR000027&quot; 
   description=&quot;Displays records for specified Grid Square ... 
   Modified for SR000027&quot; &gt;</P>
  <P>
   Amongst the easiest things to change in a report are the column 
   widths, the order in which they appear and the column headings. In 
   most reports the column layout is defined near the end of the report, 
   so for example, to change the width of the spatial reference column 
   in Sq2, change 60 to 80 in:</P>
  <P>
   &lt;Column name=&quot;Spatial_Ref&quot; width=&quot;60&quot; 
   position=&quot;2&quot; caption=&quot;Spatial Ref&quot; /&gt;</P>
  <P>
   To change the order in which the columns appear, simply change the 
   position attributes for each column. Similarly, you can change the 
   column heading by altering the caption attribute. If you don't want a 
   column to appear in the report add a visible attribute to the column 
   and set it to false, e.g. visible=&quot;false&quot;.</P>
  <P>
   It is also relatively easy to add in extra columns if they are for 
   data from tables that are already used, e.g. Spatial_Ref_Qualifier if 
   the Sample table is already used. In Sq2 you would add 
   &quot;S.Spatial_Ref_Qualifier,&quot; after &quot;S.Spatial_ref,&quot; 
   in the SELECT clause near the start and an appropriate column name 
   clause, such as &lt;Column name=&quot;Spatial_ref_qualifier&quot; 
   width=&quot;80&quot; position=&quot;3&quot; caption=&quot;Spatial Ref 
   Qual&quot; /&gt;. Note that the positions of the other columns would 
   need to be changed. Also, the S in &quot;S.Spatial_ref,&quot; is an 
   alias for the Sample table as defined in the FROM clause.</P>
