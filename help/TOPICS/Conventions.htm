   Conventions used in this Help file</H1>
  <H3>
   The keyboard</H3>
  <P>
   When you are instructed to press a key, it is shown in triangular 
   brackets, e.g. &lt;Enter&gt; means 'press the Enter (or Return) key 
   on your keyboard'. &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; means hold down the control key 
   (marked 'Ctrl') and press 'V' on your keyboard at the same time.</P>
  <P>
   The keys to move the cursor around the screen, which are often 
   labelled on the keyboard with arrows pointing upwards, downwards, to 
   the left and to the right, are referred to as &lt;Up&gt;, 
   &lt;Down&gt;, &lt;Left&gt; and &lt;Right&gt;.</P>
  <H3>
   Buttons on the screen</H3>
  <P>
   Where buttons are just identified by an <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">icon</SPAN> 
   (picture), the icon is used in the help file (e.g. 'click <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\find.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">').
    Buttons that are identified by <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">labels</SPAN> 
   are referred to by giving the label in square brackets, e.g. 'choose 
   [OK] to finish').</P>
  <H3>
   Warnings and tips</H3>
  <P>
   Things you should really know about and/or need to watch out for are 
   shown like this:</P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOTE</SPAN>: You really <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">MUST</SPAN> 
   do this and <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NOT</SPAN> this.</P>
  <P>
   Useful hints and tips are shown like this:</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">TIP</SPAN>: This will make life easier.</P>
  <H3>
   Links</H3>
  <P>
   Hyperlinks are used widely in this Help file so that you can jump to 
   another topic from the point at which it is mentioned. They appear <A HREF="Overview.htm">like
    this</A>. You know when you are over a link because the cursor 
   changes to a pointing finger <IMG SRC="..\CursorImages\Hand.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="22" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">.
    You can use the <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\BackHelp.gif" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="32" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   button to return to the topic you came from.</P>
  <P>
   You will also find glossary items (e.g. <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/Taxon.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">taxon</A>)
    which show a definition in a pop-up window, rather than taking you 
   to another topic. Just click outside the pop-up window to dismiss it.</P>
