    Choose the type of administrative area (e.g. Vice-county, English 
    Civil Parish) from the list in the box at the top. The 'Available' 
    list will then show the administrative areas of that type.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Move the names of administrative areas whose associated observations 
    you want to see in the report into the 'Selected' list. See <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Add_Items.htm">Add</A> 
    and <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Remove_Items.htm">Remove</A> items from 
    selected list.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You can add one or more names to the 'Selected' list, and then select 
    a different type. This will result in a different 'Available' list 
    from which you can make additional selections. This allows you to 
    build up a list of areas of different types (e.g. 
    Vice-county,1974-1996 County and Unitary).</P>
   </UL>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">TIP:</SPAN> If a name is moved into 
   the 'Selected' list, all of its children in the hierarchy will 
   automatically be added as well. For example, if you add a 1974-1996 
   English County to the selected list, its districts will also be 
   added. If you don&#146;t want to include the districts for some 
   reason, remove them from the 'Selected' list in the normal way. See <A HREF="Report_Wizard_Remove_Items.htm">Remove
    items.</A></P>
  <P CLASS="warning">
   An observation is linked to an Administrative Area via a Survey event 
   or Sample which refers to a Location which has this information 
   listed (<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Locations - Geo Info - 
   Administrative Areas</SPAN>). Therefore, a report which uses this 
   feature will only include records with such a linkage.</P>
