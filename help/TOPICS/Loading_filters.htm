   Loading filters</H1>
  <P>
   Filters that have been saved when revalidating or importing data can 
   be loaded at any time so that the data concerned can be viewed.</P>
  <H3>
   To load a filter:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools - Load External Filter</SPAN> 
    from the main menu.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Navigate to where the filter has been stored and select the required 
    one. By default, filters saved by <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
    will be stored in the User Files folder in your <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
     </SPAN>folder or in \User Files\Reports\Output. For a standard 
    standalone installation with Windows XP, this will be found in 
    C:\Program Files\Recorder 6\User Files.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click [Open] to load the filter.</P>
   </UL>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   When an external filter file is loaded, the filter is applied to the 
   relevant windows, i.e. observations, locations or one of the other 
   main data entry windows. Expand the items as normal by clicking on 
   the <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\TreePlus.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0" LOOP="0"> 
   beside them and view different windows in the normal way. Any item 
   actually part of the filter is shown highlighted in a different 
   colour, so that parent items which are displayed but not part of the 
   filter can be discerned. Floating the cursor over a highlighted item 
   displays some details, if present in the filter file.</P>
  <P CLASS="note">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note</SPAN>: selecting an item and 
   clicking on the * on the numeric keypad on the keyboard will expand 
   that item in full.</P>
  <H3>
   To remove a filter:</H3>
  <P>
   When a filter is applied to a window (either by loading a filter, 
   using the <A HREF="Simple_filter.htm">Simple filter</A> tool, or as a 
   result of using the [<A HREF="Related_Data.htm">Related data</A>] 
   button from another window), a [Show All] button appears towards the 
   bottom right-hand corner of the window.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click [Show All] and the filter will be removed.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    All data in the window will be accessible again via the hierarchy, or 
    list, in the left-hand panel.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    The item that was selected when the [Show All] button was clicked 
    will be highlighted.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    &nbsp;The [Show All] button will disappear again.</P>

    revalidating data - [Save Details] on the results window allows you 
    to save the details of the invalid items in a file that can be loaded 
    as a filter to enable you to view them at any time - see <A HREF="Validating_data.htm">Validating
     data</A>.</P>

   <P>
    importing data</P>
   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     [Save Details] on the Invalid items tab at the analysis stage allows 
     you to save the details of the invalid items in a file - see <A HREF="Invalid_Items.htm">Invalid
      items</A>. If the import came from another copy of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
      </SPAN>this file can be used to help resolve the problems in that system.</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Save the list of imported records 
     as a filter file so that you can review them later</SPAN> on the 
     completion message at the end of the import allows you to save the 
     details of the imported items in a file that can be loaded as a 
     filter at a later date - see <A HREF="Import_Analysis.htm">Analysis 
     and import</A>.</P>

   Filter file format</H3>
  <P>
   The external filter files created by <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   are text files with an extension of <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">.ref</SPAN>.
    The format is:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    First line: <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Description:</SPAN> 
    followed by details of the process that created the filter.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Subsequent lines: for each item in the filter, a line with the 
    following tab separated values:</P>
   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Table name from the database<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Primary key<BR>
     <LI CLASS="mvd-P">Details - optional - text that in the case of 
     revalidations will explain why the item has been identified as 
     invalid. This is the message that will appear when you load the 
     filter and float the cursor over the highlighted items.</P>
