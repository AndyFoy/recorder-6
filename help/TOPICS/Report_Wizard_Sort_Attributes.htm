   When you have selected the data fields you want to print or export, 
   you will see this screen which asks you to indicate the required 
   order for sorting the selected rows.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\ScreenShots\Wizard Sort Attributes.gif" WIDTH="422" HEIGHT="367" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The attributes you chose in the previous screen will be listed as 
   well as some others that, whilst not displayed, form the basis of the 
   report. You can choose to sort the selected observations by one or 
   more of these attributes. You don't have to select any of the 
   attributes (in which case the selected rows will be ordered by the 
   key-field of the relevant table &#150; taxon_occurrence or biotope_occurrence),</P>
  <H3>
   To specify sort order:</H3>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    As with the attribute selection screen, attributes are placed into 
    blocks for convenience. To see the attributes, click on the <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\TreePlus.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="9" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    sign for the block.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Highlight one of the attributes by clicking it with your mouse, or 
    move the highlight bar over it using the &lt;up arrow&gt;, &lt;down 
    arrow&gt;, &lt;PgUp&gt;, &lt;PgDn&gt;, &lt;Home&gt; or &lt;End&gt; keys.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click the <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\SortAscending.gif" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="22" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    button to sort in ascending order by this item, or <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\SortDescending.gif" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="22" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    to sort in descending order</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you select more than one field by which to sort, observations will 
    be sorted by the first attribute you selected, then the second, etc. 
    This ordering is indicated by the numbers which appear next to 
    selected items. For example, in the screen-shot above, rows will be 
    sorted by Sample Location name, then by Taxon name and then by Sample 
    date in descending order (i.e. the most recent date first).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you wish to change your mind about one of the attributes you have 
    selected, then highlight it and press the <IMG SRC="..\ButtonImages\DeleteSort.gif" WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="22" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
    button. The observations will no longer be sorted by this attribute. 
    The order of the other attributes chosen for sorting will be adjusted 
    accordingly. For example, if you deselected Taxon name in the 
    screen-shot above, Sample date would become the second sort 
    attribute, and so the number next to it would change to '2'.</P>
