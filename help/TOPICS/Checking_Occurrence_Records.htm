   Checking observations</H1>
  <P>
   When an observation is marked as 'Checked', it means that the 
   information stored in the database has been compared with the 
   original (e.g. checked against the record card), preferably by 
   somebody other than the person who made the data entry, and is an 
   accurate transcription. It is not intended to imply that the original 
   information was necessarily correct, only that it has been correctly entered.</P>
