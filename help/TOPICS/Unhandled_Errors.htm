   Unhandled Errors</H1>
  <P>
   If users make mistakes when using <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN>, the system will often display an appropriate message 
   telling them what is wrong. They can then correct the problem and 
   continue using the system. However, from time to time, problems occur 
   that the system cannot handle. In this case an exception message like 
   this appears:</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <IMG SRC="..\ScreenShots\Unhandled Error.gif" WIDTH="531" HEIGHT="493" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   As stated in the information at the top of the message it will be 
   saved as a text file in the specified location. Multiple files can be 
   saved and the system automatically deletes any over 7 days old. Much 
   of the information in the message will be unintelligible to most 
   users but some of it can help developers diagnose and fix the 
   problem. The exception message at the end of the screen shot can 
   sometimes be used to find more information about the problem that has occurred.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If you get a message like this, for example, when you are entering 
   data, please check whether the system has done what you asked it to 
   do. Sometimes it will have done what you wanted it to do and there is 
   no need to re-enter the data.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If the application will not continue, try closing it, re-opening it 
   and doing what you were trying to do more carefully.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   If the unhandled error continues to occur:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    check whether the exception message is listed in the <A HREF="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4914">Resources
     - Known Issues and Errors</A> section of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
    web site, <A HREF="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder">www.jncc.gov.uk/recorder</A>.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    try searching the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>Forum,
     part of the <A HREF="http://forums.nbn.org.uk/index.php">NBN Forum</A>,
     for other occurrences of the same problem. Googling &#145;NBN Forum 
    xxx&#146; where xxx is an extract of the exception message will 
    sometimes find other reports of it.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
    report it on the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder </SPAN>Forum,
     part of the <A HREF="http://forums.nbn.org.uk/index.php">NBN Forum</A>.
     When reporting problems please provide as much information as 
    possible - see <A HREF="Reporting_Bugs.htm">Reporting bugs</A>.</P>
   </UL>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   Access violation messages, as in the screen shot above, are generic 
   messages which aren't very helpful for users but often the exception 
   message will contain something that can be used to find more 
   information which may offer a solution or work around.</P>
