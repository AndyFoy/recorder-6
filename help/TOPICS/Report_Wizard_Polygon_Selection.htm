   You see this screen if you selected the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Restrict

   Wizard. It is used to select the polygons on the map that you want to 
   use to select observations (the report will then include observations 
   which fall within the selected polygons).</P>

       This list initially shows the names of your polygon layers. 
       Double-click on a name, or click the <IMG SRC="..\buttonimages\TreePlus.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="9" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
       button, to show the polygons on that layer. If you have linked a 
       polygon to a location, you will see the name of the location, 
       otherwise it will be shown as &quot;Unlinked Polygon [ID: <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">nnn</SPAN>]&quot;.
        You can select a polygon by clicking the check-box (so that it is 
       ticked). Click again to unselect (which removes the tick).</TD>

  <P CLASS="warning">
   Until the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Include/Exclude 
   overlapping grid squares in report results</SPAN> options were 
   introduced in 2008, an observation was selected for the report if its 
   spatial reference fell within one of the selected polygons. Grid 
   references like 10km squares, 1km squares or tetrads (2km squares) 
   are represented internally by the spatial reference of the bottom 
   left-hand corner. So, an observation for a 1km square, for example, 
   was considered for the report if its bottom left-hand corner was 
   within the polygon and irrespective of whether any other part of the 
   1km square was within the polygon. Now you have the option to specify 
   whether you want grid squares that overlap the polygon boundary 
   included or excluded from the report results.</P>
