   important. Use the following keys to move around and edit.</P>

       Look-up. If a grid-cell contains a value looked up from elsewhere 
       (like a Biotope) then &lt;F2&gt; will open the appropriate window to

   Tip: Whilst it is undoubtedly quicker to type in data using the 
   keyboard only, there are still some operations where using the mouse 
   can be faster. For example, if you look up a value (like a Location 
   name or a species name) and are presented with a lengthy list of 
   possible matches, it is usually quicker to double-click the one you 
   want than it is to navigate to it using the cursor keys.
