   is a text format which uses an <A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/XML_glossary.htm');" ONMOUSEOVER="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" CLASS="BSSCPopup">XML</A> 
   schema to encode the data and store it in a file with an extension of 
   .xml. The advantage is that it is a generic format, not tied to any 
   particular software. The disadvantage is that the files produced are 
   enormous and take considerable amounts of time to process. The 
   original idea was to promote a transfer format which could be used by 
   any biological recording software. This has not proved popular 
   because of the complexity of the XML syntax and because of the large 
   processing overheads in parsing and loading the data. However, this 
   format does have a potential role in securely archiving data for the 
   long term. Data written to this format could be stored on a robust 
   storage media such as CD and, because the file is plain text, will 
   not require any special software to read it in future, i.e. it is not 
   tied to some version of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN> 
   that can understand a particular data format still being available. 
   Also the XML tags provide a degree of self-documentation, i.e. the 
   names of the tags go a long way towards identifying and documenting 
   the data they contain.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" ALIGN=LEFT>
   Because of the size of these files, it is not the recommended format 
   for exchanging data between copies of <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;">,
    with one exception. When</SPAN> exporting data from <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    6</SPAN> for importing into <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Recorder
    2002</SPAN> it is necessary to use <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">NBN
    Data</SPAN> because this copes with differences in database 
   structure between the two systems whereas the <A HREF="Export_to_NBN_Access_Database.htm">NBN
    Access Database (zipped)</A> format does not.</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : left;" CLASS="note" ALIGN=LEFT>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">TIP:</SPAN> <A HREF="XML.htm">XML</A> 
   files are very verbose and quite large. If you are going to send them 
   by e-mail, or on a low capacity medium, it is sensible to compress 
   them first, using the compression facilities in Windows XP or one of 
   the many compression tools, such as <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><A HREF="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Glossary/Winzip.htm');" onMouseOver="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event)" class="BSSCPopup">WinZip</A></SPAN>,
    which are readily available. XML files compress very well, typically 
   98% or more.</P>
