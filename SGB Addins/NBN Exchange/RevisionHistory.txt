version 6.17.0.9 of 17/12/2012

- fix a bug in the SQL Server function to write date to the output file. This caused leap years to be handled
  incorrectly.

- Truncate Recorder and Determiner names(s) to 140 characters (the size of the fiesl used by the NBN Gateway
  database). The maximum length of 255 for these fields, shown below, was an incorrectly specified by NBN!

version 6.15 release 1 12/07/2010

- fixed a bug where "-Y" type dates where output as "yyyy -"

- changed the options screen so that sample type, comment and measurements are not selected by default. The user has
  to explicitly set these options if they want them. With theses items selected by default, the NBN Data Officers felt that 
  they needed to contact users each time one of these columns appeared in submitted datasets to make sure they really meant
  to export this data.

- date type "P" (Season year) is not supported by NBN Gateway. They can equally be interpreted as a month range (i.e.
  type "OO" - in which case "Spring 2010" will be interpreted as "March - May 2010"). So the nbn_exchange_basic_update
  stored procedure now changes DateType "P" to "OO" in the temporary tablebefore output is written.

- date types "S" (season without a year) and "M" (month without a year) are not supported by the NBN Gateway. So the 
  nbn_exchange_basic_update stored procedure now drops rows with these date types from the temporary table before output 
  is written.

- the East and North fields are removed if they are unused. The grid ref is output if the SPATIAL_REF_SYSTEM is "OSGB" or
  "OSNI", otherwise the LAT and LONG values are output to the East and North fields. In most cases, terrestrial and
  freshwater data from the UK will not have any rows where the East and North fields are used. Therefore these rows are dropped
  from the temp table if they are empty after spatial refs have all been processed. Effects the nbn_exchange_basic_update
  stored procedure.

- The NBN Gateway allows a maximum of 255 characters for Recorder and Determiner names and Attribute names and a max of 80
  characters for the SiteName. The output from these fields is therefore truncated (at the nearest word boundary) to honour
  these limitations.

- Early versions of this addin populated the SiteName field with a concatenation of the SAMPLE.LOCATION_NAME and the preferred
  ITEM_NAME of the LOCATION. But this often produced a string that was too long for the 80 character limit on the NBN Gateway's
  SiteName field. So 6.13 was changed so that the SAMPLE.LOCATION_NAME was used  and then, in cases where the result was empty,
  the LOCATION ITEM_NAME was used. However, this is not always what users want. So this version has an option by which the user
  can choose to populate SiteName with either SAMPLE.LOCATION_NAME first or LOCATION ITEM_NAME first and then use the other field 
  to fill blanks. This required changes in the options screen and aslo changes to the nbn_exchange_basic_update stored 
  procedure so that it can be passed a parameter indicating the user's choice.

version 6.13 release 2 21/01/2009

- Fixed so that SAMPLE.LOCATION_NAME is returned in the SiteName field if no LOCATION is specified in a record.
  This change affects the Stored Procedure nbn_exchange_basic_update
  "OR LEN(SiteName)=0" added to the WHERE clause so that the it happens whether the SiteName field is either NULL or empty

- Strip RTF codes from comments
  This change affects Stored Procedure nbn_exchange_add_comment
  Comments are passed through the Rec6 user defined function ufn_RtfToPlaintext. Note that this is SLOW!

- Strip Return and Linefeed characters from comments
  This change affects Stored Procedure nbn_exchange_add_comment
  A new user defined function nbn_exchange_strip_LFCR is added to do this

These two changes have quite a performance hit. To minimise this, the Stored procedure works as follows:
  - queries the records to be exported for cases WHERE comments start "{\rtf" and passes them through ufn_RtfToPlaintext
  - queries records to be exported where the export comment field is still null and WHERE comments contains CR or LF
    and passes them through nbn_exchange_strip_LFCR
  - simply copies in the comment for any remaining records where the output comment field is still null

- Fix for problems where the addin fails to export anything.

  It seems that the Recorder interface function IExportFilter6.ExportFileWithFilteredInvalids is not reporting the 
  LastExportError from the addin if it returns False (as IExportFilter.ExportFile does). 
  Consequently exceptions in the addin are "silent". If the addin encountered an error, it just terminated without
  Recorder reporting any error message.
  Fixed to show its own error message if an exception occurs internally.

  One reason this happened was due to an unusaul condition where nbn_exchange_date_to_string attempted to convert a NULL date 
  to a string and got stuck in an infinite loop. This (eventually) caused a time-out exception. The user defined function
  nbn_exchange_date_to_string has been modified to break out of this loop. The way dates are handled by Stored Procedure 
  nbn_exchange_basic_update has been modified to ensure NULL dates are exported as expected.

  Another reason (Craig Slawson's problem) was that one of his measurement fields was called "Substrate" - which duplicates
  an existing field name. This caused an SQL error when trying to add the duplicate column name to the temporary table. 
  Such duplicated names are now suffixed with a digit - starting at 2. So in this case, the measurement will be 
  labeled "Substrate2" in the export file.


- Fixed problems reported by Charles Roper and Les Hill where the exporter times out during large exports.
  The routine to call the Stored Procedures now sets the CommandTimeout parameter to zero (it was previously
  using the default setting of 30 secs). Zero means "never timeout". With big datasets, this could be caused
  by the SQL which finds which MEASUREMENT_QUALIFIERs are used. This can be made a lot faster by putting an index
  on MEASUREMENT_QUALIFIER_KET in TAXON_OCCURRENCE_DATA.

- Records attached to user-added species were being exported. This causes problems when attempting to import
  at the NBN Gateway end because the TAXON_VERSION_KEY is not in the NBN Taxon Dictionary. 
  Fixed so that rows where the TAXON_VERSION entry is not system supplied are no longer exported. 

- Using the [Cancel] button in the options dialog was not actually cancelling the export and produced an error
  message. Fixed.
