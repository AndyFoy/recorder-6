Delete Survey Addin for Recorder 6
==================================

11/08/2009 - modified to handle SURVEY tags
-------------------------------------------
If a SURVEY was tagged, referential integrity constraints between SURVEY and SURVEY_TAG
prevented the SURBVEY from being deleted.

If the SURVEY is just to be deleted, delete any entries under that SURVEY_KEY from SURVEY_TAG
If the SURVEY is being emptied, change SURVEY_KEYs in SURVEY_TAG to "DeleteSurveyTemp",
delete the SURVEY and then change them back to the original key

(This is the same action that is used for SURVEY_KEYs in EXPORT_FILTER_SURVEY, so the
function has been generalied to handle both tables. This will make it easier to maintain
in future if any further tables containing SURVEY_KEY are added.)
